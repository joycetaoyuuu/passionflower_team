It’s a great fog lifter from the stress of the day and a nice way to really mellow me out. The flavor by itself is something to get used to, but I’ve found most things like this just become its own thing after a while. It’s like once you start drinking black coffee no sugar. Once you get over the hump, you can start to appreciate other flavors you never noticed before. Some of the foreign flavors in Passion Flower are ok once you get to know them. Also, I mix it with something I enjoy too. It all depends. Good stuff!"

My only concern is that one time it made my period to start one week early. I googled and yes, passion flower makes your uterus contract more, so no surprise it happened to me. I consulted with my therapist who said if I only use it no more than once a week, it should be fine. It only happened one time, and now I’m more cautious and use it only if I cannot fall asleep for longer than 2-3 hours.

The product seems to be effective in supporting my hormonal health, which was my primary reason for choosing Chrysin.

Additionally, the packaging is convenient and the instructions are clear, making it easy to follow the recommended dosage. I also appreciate the reasonable price point, which offers great value for a high-quality supplement.

While it's still early days, my experience with Swanson Chrysin has been very positive. If you’re looking for a reliable and effective Chrysin supplement, I highly recommend giving Swanson a try. I’m looking forward to seeing the long-term benefits as I continue to use it."

4635,"Posted on Apr 10, 2024",Good for sleep and anxiety,"This is a good passion flower supplement from a reputable brand.

Key benefits of passion flower supplements:
Anxiety relief: Several studies have found that passion flower can help reduce anxiety, including before medical procedures like surgery. The anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects are thought to be due to passion flower's impact on neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine.

Improved sleep: Passion flower has been shown to help improve sleep quality and insomnia when taken as a tea or supplement, likely due to its calming effects on the brain.

Menopausal symptom relief: Research indicates passion flower may help alleviate menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and insomnia, potentially providing an alternative to hormone therapy.

Reduced blood pressure: Animal studies suggest passion flower extract may help lower blood pressure, possibly through its antioxidant and GABA-promoting properties.

ADHD symptom improvement: Some preliminary evidence indicates passion flower may help reduce ADHD symptoms."

To maintain health, movement is necessary. In the century of technological development, our motor activity has decreased to a minimum. We get to work by transport, we go up to the apartment by elevator, we do not have hard physical work at home, because there are vacuum cleaners, washing machines and other benefits of civilization. In the evening, we don't go for a walk, but watch TV or ""surf"" on the Internet. And movement of the body is necessary, without it our well-being will not improve. Sometimes it's easier to go to the gym or fitness class than to force yourself to do something at home. Come on! Choose what you like and do it! Of course, it can be advised to get to work on foot and climb to the floor without using the elevator. But we are always in a hurry! The only way out is the gym and active recreation. Physical activity is a necessity for a healthy lifestyle"

Better to take it one hour before sleep and not recommend to take it if you have next day very early meetings or some important appointments because it’s keeping the results a bit longer and you feel a bit relaxed until afternoon…. But it’s good quality tablets to have some rest. Do not mix it with alcohol or any drags because IT’s contains some Valerian extract. Size is okay, one is enough. "

I missed one night and my sleep was horrible. Each pill has little bit of everything in it. I take a few hours before bedtime and that works for me. I don’t think what works for me would work for everyone so you have to experiment."
116490,"Posted on Apr 2, 2024",Helps,"The variety of ingredients seem to be of good quality. Once you get past the smell which is sort of like rotting fish, these large pills take anywhere from 30 min. to 1 hr. to gently induce a mild sleepiness. 1 pill will keep me under for about 4 hrs. then I have to take another one and I was hoping for a somewhat greater effectiveness to really make me drowsy, so for me they're just average. Have to say that I don't wake up feeling groggy, so they're good also in that respect. Will continue to use them as perhaps it takes my body time to adjust after using sublingual melatonin by itself for many years but will keep the sublingual melatonin on the back burner.
UPDATE--My body has adjusted to ""Luna"". Taken about 1/2 hr. prior to hopeful sleep, fall into a good sound sleep until the bladder says 'wake up'! Luna does help and will reorder. Should mention that I do follow up the 1 Luna softgel with a 1 mg. sublingual melatonin, all of which has been providing some much-needed restful sleep."

One of the biggest benefits I’ve noticed is that I fall asleep more quickly and wake up feeling more rested. The taste is neutral, which is a plus, as some supplements can have an unpleasant aftertaste.

I particularly like that these are vegetarian capsules, aligning with my dietary preferences.

One of the biggest improvements I've noticed is waking up feeling more refreshed and less groggy compared to other sleep aids I've tried. There were a few nights where I experienced vivid dreams, but they weren't unpleasant, just more intense than usual. It's also worth mentioning that I didn't have any digestive issues, which can sometimes be a problem with supplements.

Its effectiveness is truly impressive. After starting to take them, I noticed a tangible change in my level of calmness. Not only do I feel more relaxed, but I also manage to maintain my clarity and focus throughout the day.
Another aspect that I greatly appreciate about these capsules is their natural composition. As a vegan and nature lover, I find it very important that the products I use are as natural and environmentally friendly as possible. Nature's Truth's Calm Caps perfectly reflect this philosophy of mine.
Moreover, the value for money is excellent. Not only does the product work great, but the price is also very reasonable, considering the number of capsules you receive per package.
Finally, I have not experienced any unwanted side effects. This is a great advantage, as many similar products can cause drowsiness or other unwanted effects. With Calm Caps, on the other hand, I simply feel calmer and more relaxed, while maintaining my normal energy and attention.

My doc put me on prosac which I hated.  I asked a health food store what I could do naturally and they recommended HTP-CALM.  I am now on the other side of menopause and 6 years later I am still taking it.  I've always been hyper with my mind racing a zillion miles an hour and with it I am more creative, focused and a happier human.  If I miss a dose I can tell right away because the anxiety returns.

I was taking St. John's Wort for a while, but after about 6 weeks, I only noticed some improvement, but no much during my ""hot"" days when I ovulate and several days priror to my period. 

I've been taking this for about 4 weeks now, and I had the mildest pms in recent memory. I was a tad irritable, but nothing like the godzilla I can turn into sometimes. 

I also sleep so much better while taking these, and it's nice to not be groggy or feel blunted if one is taking a sedative. It's also helped with anxiety associated with stress as well.

The bottle came with the inside seal open (most likely stuck on the lid and pulled off when I opened it). Iherb answered my email very promptly on a Sunday no less, and without hesitation sent out another bottle. I can't say enough about this site and the amazing products they carry. Thank you!"

It's like a warm hug in a mug, and let me tell you, we've got quite a collection of their teas.

One of the things I really appreciate about Traditional Medicinals is their commitment to using organic and high-quality ingredients. It's like you're getting a little dose of nature's best stuff with every sip.

Now, as for the Lavender Mint tea, it's our go-to choice when we need a bit of relaxation, especially before bedtime. It's like a gentle lullaby for the senses. The combination of soothing lavender and refreshing mint is just pure magic.

It's one of those teas that helps you unwind and shake off the day's stress. Plus, it's caffeine-free, so it won't keep you tossing and turning at night."

I had had a late dinner and was dreading a night of tossing and turning but lo and behold I slept through the night and the next morning I woke fresh with no residual effects of the dinner from previous night.

She's 7 now and we haven't found the one supplement which could help with her anxiety while going on a car rides or through a storm or fireworks. Since it has a lot of natural calming herbs, I hope they will work for her nervous system to calm down. It also has L-Tryptofan, which i've noticed helps her a little bit (in other supplements that she taken), so my hopes are high for this one. Valerian, chamomile and passion flower all have calming effects on people, so it should work for her also :)) Thiamine is B1 vitamin, which gets depleted when a body is in a stressful state, so we'll see how it affects her.

My golly the first night we used them I gave her and my youngest son cuddles and sang a song and they just never moved from there - straight to sleep by 7:30pm!!!! The older son and daughter followed shortly after! My husband and I couldn’t believe it - it’s been so long that we’ve had anytime to ourselves in an evening. 
We did have wakes that first night but that was more to do with the dogs disrupting and haven’t since then. Didn’t use them over weekend and they were all back to their usual self struggling to sleep! It has made a huge difference for this family, they can now get all the sleep they desperately need!

You can't be too sensitive to smells to use this, and if you need a nerve pill, you're probably not feeling too tolerant. I would say it works decently and will definitely take the edge off but I don't use it as much because of the smell. I love this brand  and feel they make good products at a reasonable cost, though the cost has gone up a lot in the post covid inflation bonanza,  but you get your money's worth. I don't take this as often as I would if the smell wasn't so pungent but I use it when I really need to calm down or can't sleep. I also got the Sleep one and the smell is even more pungent so I use this instead.

Nature's Answer Melatonin+ is a dietary supplement designed to support healthy sleep patterns and promote relaxation. This review evaluates the product based on its ingredients, effectiveness, safety, value for money, and overall quality.

Key Features:

Melatonin Formula: Each capsule of Nature's Answer Melatonin+ contains 5 mg of melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by the body to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Melatonin supplementation may help improve sleep quality, reduce sleep latency, and alleviate symptoms of insomnia and jet lag.

Vegetarian Capsules: The product features vegetarian capsules, making it suitable for individuals following vegetarian or vegan lifestyles. This ensures broader accessibility and meets the preferences of diverse consumer groups.

These complementary ingredients enhance the product's effectiveness in promoting relaxation and restful sleep.

Ingredients and Benefits:

Melatonin: Melatonin is a hormone synthesized in the pineal gland in response to darkness, signaling the body that it's time to sleep. Supplementing with melatonin may help regulate sleep patterns, especially for individuals with insomnia, jet lag, or shift work-related sleep disturbances.

Valerian Root: Valerian root is a herb commonly used in traditional medicine to promote relaxation and alleviate anxiety and insomnia. It may enhance the sedative effects of melatonin and contribute to better sleep quality and duration.

Chamomile: Chamomile is well-known for its calming properties and is often used as a natural remedy for insomnia and anxiety. It may help reduce stress and promote relaxation, supporting a more restful sleep environment.

Effectiveness and Benefits:

Improved Sleep Quality: Users of Nature's Answer Melatonin+ report experiencing improved sleep quality, including faster sleep onset, reduced nighttime awakenings, and deeper, more restorative sleep. The combination of melatonin and complementary herbal ingredients promotes relaxation and creates conducive conditions for falling asleep and staying asleep throughout the night.

Reduced Sleep Latency: Melatonin supplementation can help reduce sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep after going to bed. By initiating the sleep process more efficiently, individuals can enjoy a more seamless transition from wakefulness to sleep, leading to a more satisfying and rejuvenating sleep experience."

103615,"Posted on Sep 29, 2024",Anxious 11 Year Old,"My daughter gets very anxious about going to school, once she is there she is fine, however the lead up to school of an evening or in the morning can be traumatic.

She gets herself worked up and in a state of panic that she cannot control and all she wants is her safe space which is to be at home and be with us.

We started using these after reading the reviews of how it’s helped calm other children and I have to say it’s helping my child. She has noticed a difference and so have we since taking these, she feels calmer and more in control or able to handle her anxiety better.

We also found even though they are chewable we try and get her to suck them slowly on the way to school as another way to occupy her and getting her mind off wondering and getting anxious.

Great quality product and tastes good, and seems to be helping, have ordered a few bottles as taking two a day you can get through them pretty quickly.

120864,"Posted on Feb 27, 2024",Curious Little Squares,"Creamsicle...only if you really stop thinking about the magnesium that comes through in these. Yes, they have an ""orangish-vanilla"" flavor to them but they are not that great tasting. Thankfully they aren't too sweet as other companies tend to over sweeten their supplements. They melt easily, so keep them in a cool/dry place to avoid any issues (you can even pop them in the fridge or freezer for a minute or so before consuming but don't store them there due to the moisture). Not sure if they are effective as I didn't really pay attention while using them over a course of a few days. Most likely we won't buy again as there are other magnesium supplements that we like better (mainly gummy - though they tend to be coated in sugar unlike these; thus one drawback for gummies). Still they are worth a try if you don't like taking magnesium powders, capsules or tablets. Just beware, they tend to stick to the teeth & need to be brushed off if you don't chew them quickly (or taken with some water to help remove from the teeth)."
120864,"Posted on Nov 3, 2023",Just fine,"Tastes great, not sure how much it’s effective because I only take half a dose. However I do like it. Not sure if I would repurchase.

First of all, I was intrigued by the ingredients - Turmeric, Cocoa, and Lemon balm. It's not every day you come across a hot cocoa blend with such a unique combination of superfoods. And the best part? It contains zero sugar! As someone who tries to watch their sugar intake, this was a big plus for me.

The taste and aroma of the Gold Chocolate are simply incredible. The blend of cocoa and turmeric creates a rich, warm, and comforting flavor. It's like a cozy hug in a cup! The hint of lemon balm adds a subtle citrusy note that balances the sweetness perfectly. This chocolate has quickly become my go-to drink for winding down after a long day."

Not greasy even in summer, from the northern hemisphere so it tends to be pretty dry. Scent is rather uplifting rather than calming. I would say moisturizing power is so and so.

When it's the hands or feet, I use the Lavender one which is amazing as well. They are very moisturizing and great for sensitive skin.

I’m not a fan of this scent it smells to medicine like but the fact that I love the lavender and almond and the way it moisturizes your skin is a plus.

121212,"Posted on Feb 8, 2024",Moisturizing and good scent ,"The scent is pleasing and not too strong, texture is ok absorbs fast and leaves a light film of protection when dried. Depends on individual, most guys probably won’t like it. "
121212,"Posted on Oct 8, 2023",Great lotion,"This  lotion is light and hydrating. I don't know why the other reviewer said it smells weird and stays strong smelling. It doesn't. If you are used to ""perfumey"" lotions that have have fake scents then you might not go for this. All the scents are from the essential oils and they are really nice.  It's a little earthy (like a slight sandalwood) so if you like flowery sweet smells it might not be your thing. Again, it's very faint after  a while. I love Zum. It's hard to find this price point with quality ingredients. They also use meadowfoam which another expensive brand has with fake perfume stink so I'm grateful this one is natural! :)"

Is my first time with the Gaia Herbs brand and their type of herbal  release called Liquid Phyto-Caps® and the impression was positive. Capsules of standard size and not difficult to swallow. To be considered that the dosage involves the use of 3 capsules. 
The product is indicated for occasional cases and not for severe causes, since when one cannot sleep the causes can be different and related to excessive stress, too hectic life, excessive exercise etc... 
In my case this supplement made only with herbal ingredients (California Poppy, Skullcap, and Passionflower) and without melatonin has been helpful.

Even just half the dosage is enough to helpe sleep on a regular night. didn't notice any taste. size is fairly small. quality is pretty good 👍🏼 I'd have to say it's my favorite.

the pill is pretty big (in case that’s a concern to you) but very easy to swallow! i take it with water so i can’t really taste anything. do note that it’s a soft gel and not a gummy like Olly’s other stuff, so i don’t really chew it."

I have a chronic illness, called Fibromyalgia. This illness causes me sleeping difficulties.  Therefore, I need to take sleeping aids, mainly Melatonin, to be able to sleep. So, I ordered Olly™'s ""Ultra Strength Sleep"" softgels. I really liked the results that I ordered another bottle. Also, I'll probably   order another one soon, as I'm running low.

I love the packaging also on Zum products, jt’s aesthetic. Great product not only do I love their soaps I also love the lotions and other products. Refreshing, clean and natural"
121207,"Posted on Jun 2, 2024",The Almond Scent is Perfection!,"This hand cream is giving me everything I am looking for: a mild scent, nice rich texture, quick dry time and a great price! I'm not usually into scented lotions, but I made an exception for this almond scent and am so happy I did- I really like the scent- it makes me feel fancy."
121207,"Posted on Mar 2, 2024",Very gentle effective moisturizer,"Recently I have become very sensitive to moisturizing lotions, but have excessively dry skin especially on my legs.  Very  hard to find one that doesn't cause a bad reaction.  This one is so gentle and nice, very moisturizing, not sticky, makes my legs feel smooth and silky and hydrates very well."
121207,"Posted on Aug 24, 2024",Smells yummy,"I have pretty dry skin and have been using this cream mainly for hands and feet. It smells yummy when applied and grandually mellows out, so isn't overwhelming. It is nice and creamy, feels good going on, and absorbs fairly quickly, but doesn't really seem to have lasting benefits. I would say it's better than some. "
121207,"Posted on May 13, 2024",,"It is a nice light lotion. It's not thick so, it's easy to spread. The scent is a bit strong at first but fades decently fast. 
My only problem was that my skin is very sensitive and my hands didn't agree with this lotion. My skin got very itchy and I had to stop using it as a hand cream - which was my initial intention. 
Otherwise, hydrating deeply with no heaviness to it.
The tube is pretty big too.
A good quality product for bitter almond lovers."

121207,"Posted on Mar 11, 2024",Smells Great,"This is a nice quality lotion that smells great. However the fragrance does not last as much as I would like. I use it as a hand lotion before I go to bed and it works really well. I don't use it as often as a daytime lotion, because it leaves my hands feeling a bit sticky."

19002,"Posted on Feb 1, 2024",I guess it helps with my hormonal acne,"I use this with Acne Advance which I ordered here in iHerb too, and eversince I haven’t gotten a single pimple on my chin. I usually get 3-5 pimples on my chin from time to time despite of religiously using anti-acne Korean skincare. Taking care of our skin from in the inside is something we need to consider too not just from the outside. I am glad that finally products like this is working for me. "

Will have to wait and see, but I plan to continue taking it indefinitely just for the benefits I've already experienced. Highly recommend."

66284,"Posted on May 22, 2024",Wow. Major calmer for stressful events,When we gave this to our dogs—two salukis with strong anxiety—they pretty much fell asleep immediately. This is the kind of stuff you want for when they are going to do something stressful - like go to the vet or go in a car.  They were back up to being hyper and agitated as usual later in the day so I do not know that this works well as a long-term medicine but it works well for event-related stress. They happily ate the tablet with no fuss.

They also use a typical herb blend with passion flower, camomile and lemon balm, which can help with relaxation and sleeping. Moreover, they use sweetener instead of sugar, in case you don't want to brush your teeth after taking them every time, or in case you rely on low-carb food. Great product."

The advantage is that it is added with monk fruit sugar instead of sucrose, and has coconut milk and vanilla flavors, which reduces the turmeric flavor and increases the sweetness.

It is  a good quality product and I like that it is the whole plant with no added ingredients and not a processed extract (full spectrum). I read books on herbalism and I understand it is safer to take the whole plant and not a concentrated extract. I take this for menopausal sleep disruption and I find that it helps. It is mildly sedating. However herbalists recommend you don't take this if you also have low mood as it can be mood lowering. I find Swanson to be excellent quality and value.

My son gets very hyper at night, sometimes this product helps to get him off to sleep. A bit concerned about the B6 ingredient being so high, especially if taking other supplements. Too much B6 can cause nerve damage, so it's not something I'd give my child too often as he takes multivitamins that contain b complex some days. "

The worst part is they are recommending 1 to 2 tablets! 2 is insane. 1 tablet is 147% of daily requirement,  not to mention what your child gets from food...I would really err on the side of caution with these ,parents.

Only harsh boiling conditions at elevated pressure, when the water temperature rises to 127 ° C, allow the extraction of thianine into solution. And this tyanine increases stress resistance, cognitive (cognitive) abilities, promotes concentration, improves mood.

2694,"Posted on Mar 18, 2024",A Soothing Step Towards Serenity - Natural Factors Sleep Relax,"Living with an anxiety disorder can make the simple act of going to bed a daunting nightly challenge. In my search for relief, I turned to Natural Factors Sleep Relax with Valerian & Hops. The strong valerian scent is one I find quite pleasant, though it’s worth noting it may not be universally appreciated. The capsules themselves are manageable in size and easy to swallow, which is always a plus.

The blend of natural herbs is well-curated, targeting anxiety and sleep issues. I’ve found that taking these capsules does make it easier for me to drift off to sleep, though I wish the effects were more pronounced. It’s a gentle nudge rather than a push into slumber, which might be perfect for some but leaves me wanting a bit more.

One downside I’ve encountered is the capsules’ tendency to solidify over time, turning them into tiny rocks. This was unexpected and somewhat disappointing, considering the otherwise high quality of the product. Despite this, I believe the benefits merit a solid 4-star rating. It’s a product that has eased my journey to dreamland, even if it’s not the perfect solution."

The capsules are easy to take, and having a three-month supply ensures I can maintain this beneficial routine consistently. For anyone struggling with sleep disturbances or looking for a natural way to enhance sleep quality, Sleep Relax could offer a gentle yet effective solution."

The quality is exceptional, with each capsule made from freshly ground, organic herbs that ensure maximum potency and effectiveness. It’s clear that this product was crafted with care, and the Oregon Tilth organic certification gives me confidence in its purity and sustainability.

The ingredients are purely herbal, with no unnecessary additives. I love that it’s made with gluten-free ingredients and that the capsule itself is made from non-GMO, bovine gelatin, which ensures that I’m not ingesting anything harmful. The composition is simple yet powerful, focusing on promoting healthy and restful sleep without the grogginess often associated with other sleep aids.

The size of the capsules is just right, making them easy to swallow without any discomfort. Although this product doesn’t contain added minerals, the natural herbs included are rich in nutrients that work synergistically to calm the mind and body.

As for the benefits, they’ve been remarkable. I’ve struggled with falling asleep and staying asleep for years, but since I started taking this supplement, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in both the quality and quantity of my sleep. I fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. The fact that it's formulated to reduce anxiety and daily stress is a huge bonus, leaving me feeling more balanced overall.

If you’re looking for a natural, effective way to improve your sleep without any unwanted side effects, I highly recommend this product. It’s a game-changer for anyone seeking a better night’s rest!

I fall asleep faster and wake up more rested (sleep is obviously deeper). Maybe a small downside is that I'm a little more groggy in the morning, but nothing too bad. Usually I take just 1 pill and it's enough (my weight is around 60kg).  I've taken melatonin before,but this supplement works better and I benefit from the calming effects of the other ingredients. The pills are quite big, but I guess you can break them up into smaller bits if you have trouble swallowing. It's been a great help the last few weeks since I'm going through some stressfull issues.

Some of the Amazon brands with higher dosage of even more ingredients don't work well, but ZHOU does work, as does OLLY.  After trying many formulas, I've arrived at just using ZHOU or OLLY, and I switch it up every week because I feel that your body gets accustomed to one formula and loses it's effectiveness after awhile."

The size of the capsule isn’t too large and the fact you only need one is even better! I’ve definitely already noticed a difference just after a week. Make sure you take it when you’re actually ready to go to sleep otherwise the fat burner side takes over and end up getting side tracked.

Is my first time with the Gaia Herbs brand and their type of herbal  release called Liquid Phyto-Caps® and the impression was positive. Capsules of standard size and not difficult to swallow. To be considered that the dosage involves the use of 3 capsules. 
The product is indicated for occasional cases and not for severe causes, since when one cannot sleep the causes can be different and related to excessive stress, too hectic life, excessive exercise etc... 
In my case this supplement made only with herbal ingredients (California Poppy, Skullcap, and Passionflower) and without melatonin has been helpful.

68757,"Posted on Sep 9, 2024",A good PTS without melatonin ,"I got this power to sleep because it does not contain melatonin which can give you nightmares if you take too much. I’ll mix it with the other PTS to reduce the melatonin. This one contains California poppy that helps you sleep for an alternative to the melatonin. It seems like a quality brand that provides liquid capsules instead of dry. I feel liquid is fresher and contains a more efficacious delivery of the constituents-vitamins/supplements ingredients. The size is not huge-50 pills which they want you to take 3. I’ll take 2, and one of the other ‘power to sleep’ (with melatonin) capsules to round it out. I got it on sale 28% off so bought 3! I should have enough to last for a while till the next sale."
68757,"Posted on May 22, 2024",Nice relaxing sleep facilitator ,I like this “power to sleep” by Irwin Naturals because it contains California poppy which is a gentle relaxer. I believe it also is a mild pain reliever because it’s related to poppies. I will usually take one of these with the other Irwin power to sleep that has melatonin included in it. I mix the two because I don’t like nightmares from too much melatonin. The size is a little smaller than the other style but I like the poppy ingredient so I ordered 2 bottles to balance the other P.T.S. They are also soft gels so works faster than tablets. Irwin I believe is a good quality supplement so I order several different kinds.

I was prescribed a sedative before and this is literally more effective than that was. I take Gaia's ashwagandha daily and then one of these when needed and it has truly helped.

I take this as needed and just one capsule is enough to take the edge off of any anxiety I might be feeling.  If I take two capsules, it's enough to help me sleep soundly regardless of  what I'm feeling.  This supplement is extremely high quality, and has huge benefits for me.  I no longer take a prescription for my anxiety which is a huge plus.  The herbs it has in it as ingredients are all proven anxiety treatments, so it's nice to have them all in one easy to take capsule."

It did not work for me but here is why:   A small number of people are sensitive to Valerian and have a ""hyper"" rather than sleep response to it. I happen to be one of those.

It is expensive but hey getting a good 7 hr to 8 hours sleep out weighs the cost in my opinion. I like this brand because it has the best combination of natural ingredients  that will guarantee a good night sleep.

Like many working people in the world, I have a very busy life, and need to quiet my mind as I am trying to sleep. I have long observed that melatonin puts me into Delta sleep for longer, and my joints repair themselves better at night, but all of the additional ingredients in AOR sleep are definitely noticeable.

WE GIVE OUR PUPPY (WEIGHT 8 KG) 5 SMALL BALLS IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING. SHE REALLY LIKES THE TASTE AND SHE BECAME CALMER. DOES NOT CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS. THANK YOU iherb AND THE MANUFACTURER FOR A QUALITY AND USEFUL PRODUCT. THANKS EVERYONE FOR THE LIKES 🫶.

I was impressed by the blend of Ashwagandha, chamomile, ginger, and other natural ingredients. After a few weeks of using the product, I noticed a significant difference in Max's behavior. He's calmer, more relaxed, and less reactive to loud noises.

The soft chews are easy to administer, and the fact that they're vet formulated and NASC certified gives me peace of mind. I'm so grateful for this product and would highly recommend it to any pet owner dealing with an anxious or stressed-out dog."
116775,"Posted on Aug 22, 2024",Helps calm down,"I have been trying this supplement with my dogs recently since there have been loud thunders in my area and I think somehow it does help calm them down. Of course it doesn't work in an instant but I think it helps improve their mood and reaction to the loud thunder. The packaging is convenient since I don't always give it out to my dogs I can just leave it with the cap screwed on. The size of the chew is a little bit big for small dogs though, and I haven't tried giving it to my small dog since he's a picky eater but for the bigger dogs, it works great."
116775,"Posted on Dec 7, 2023",Not bad,"I have an extremely reactive dog and nothing worked with her, this helped a bit with her being alert all the time 
The ingredients seemed good enough to try it
So I think it would work better with other dogs especially for anxiety and barking cause It worked on my other do 
I don't have any concerns but I recommend to check the ingredients to make sure ur dog is not allergic to an of them 
Good quality over all "

125237,"Posted on Aug 30, 2024",This is surprisingly effective!,"I usually take the maximum prescription sleeping pills, but I still have trouble falling asleep. I heard that melatonin supplements are good! I heard from an acquaintance that so I bought some, and I was surprised! I was skeptical about whether it really works, but after about 30 minutes to an hour, I started to feel like, ""Huh?"" It became hard to open my eyes, and after about an hour and a half, I couldn't open my eyes anymore. However, even though I can't open my eyes, my brain is awake and I'm in a dream-like state. (It's an interesting feeling, like my soul is gone.) When I'm in a relaxed state, I can fall asleep easily. Either way, I think it's very good for my body because it helps me wake up in the morning. The supplement has a cut so that it's easy to cut into half tablets, and when I think I can do it with half a tablet, I take it in half a tablet. Half a tablet is also effective. The supplement contains not only melatonin but also herbs, so it has a strong smell. I'm sorry for the bad expression, but I'm sorry when I opened it for the first time. I said it smelled bad lol. I think it also works well without the herbs, so if you are concerned about the smell, try the herb-free version. Thank you for listening to my story. Excuse me."

I normally prefer <2mg of melatonin per dose, and this is slightly above that (2.5 mg taking half of the recommended 2-gummie dose), but otherwise seems like a decent, effective mild sleep aid. Each gummie is like a dollop of strawberry jam that's been slightly dehydrated - very tasty. I will probably go back to my preferred Olly Blackberry Zen gummies once their seasonal heat-limited shipping restriction is lifted, but these are an okay substitute for the summer months."

Natural Ingredients:
One of the standout features of Herb Farm Kids Captain Concentrate is its use of natural, plant-based ingredients.

The liquid form of Captain Concentrate makes it easy to administer to children, even those who may be picky about taking supplements. The dropper allows for precise dosage, and the pleasant taste ensures that children won't hesitate to take it.

Immune Support:
I've found that Captain Concentrate is particularly effective during cold and flu season or when children are exposed to germs in school or daycare.

The vitamins are easy to swallow and don’t have any unpleasant aftertaste. However, one thing I did notice is that my urine has been more yellow than usual, but I understand this can happen with certain vitamins, especially B vitamins, and it hasn’t caused any discomfort.

The  combination of herbal and vitamin B ingredients adequately controls my anxiety without any apparent side effects or that feeling of being ""drugged"".

21595,"Posted on Sep 2, 2024",Find Your Calm with RidgeCrest Herbals' SereniZen!,"I recently picked up RidgeCrest Herbals' SereniZen, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me! The bottle has 60 capsules, which is a solid amount for a month’s supply. The packaging looks nice and is pretty user-friendly. The capsules are a good size—not too big—so they’re easy to swallow. What I really appreciate is the blend of natural ingredients like ashwagandha and rhodiola, which are known to help with stress and anxiety. Since I started taking them, I’ve noticed a significant drop in my stress levels. I feel more calm and focused during my busy days. If you’re on the lookout for something to help manage stress naturally, I highly recommend checking out SereniZen!"

within 3 days of use my little one is down to waking at only 1am and 6-7am.

I know it works on anxiety and worry because I sprayed about 7 pumps of it in my mouth after waking up about 3am with hangxiety after a night out, and I immediately regained myself instead of spiralling and fell back into sleep. In the morning, I continued to spray until the desire to criticise  myself simply diffused. I urge you to continue even when it might seem nothing is happening!! I am in awe!! Would never be without it now. "

16130,"Posted on Aug 20, 2024",FES flower essences one of the best!,"A long-standing, trusted, ethical and high-quality private company that I highly recommend.  Another staple FES blend I keep on hand. I prefer FES blends or their single essences over the Bach brand. Try Fear-Less for trips to the vet or for any other known anxiety-producing event. I mix the 1-2 sprays with ~1 oz. purified water in a glass dropper or spray bottle, then ""succuss"" it (rap bottom on soft but firm surface, e.g. palm of your hand) 8 times before each use. 
[never use straight from stock bottle for cats or other small animals; instead, make the water & flower essence mixture & add 4 drops to water bowl or put on skin or mist them with a spray; can use repeatedly before and during a known, fearful event] 
Slight alcohol taste if used straight  (for humans or large animals) from stock bottle. Water mixture keeps a long time refrigerated, or on the counter in a cool location for 2-3 days. "

Bought it for my mother in-law who suffers from anxiety and sleep disorder.. this product with natural ingredients makes her feel relaxed and helps to sleep better. It is always better to rely on homeopathy, especially at older age, when other medicine is taken, and I’m glad it helps. "

22496,"Posted on Apr 28, 2024",Every Day Moisturizer,"Recently, I broke up with my ""natural"" hair care products due to my friends SOFT hair. I asked for his routine, and it is straight organic and does not consist of ANY hair care products displayed in the hair care market. I use this as a moisturizing, every day spray for my hair. The quality of the bottle is top notch, and the spray comes out very smooth. As far as the scent, it is TRULY authentic. It smells like roses, which even though I do not personally like, it eventually fades away. Rose water alone has many benefits and reduces much of my inflation on the face and the hair. My hair loves and feels refreshed. Highly recommend!"
22496,"Posted on Sep 13, 2024",A very special little bottle of rose water,I keep going back to rose water because it smells great and softens the skin. Anything with flowers helps the skin heal because it’s natural. I sprayed it in my mouth because it said food-grade so you know it’s pure! Tastes like rose petals! The scent is really fresh roses and smells qualitative not overly fragrant. I got it on the big 28% sale so splurged. 
22496,"Posted on Sep 10, 2024",Great,I love that this product is safe and good quality ingredients and won’t cause breakouts. Quality is good and brand is trustworthy. Good for sensitive skin. Scent is mild and use for any day of the year. Bottle is glass so it’s safe and size is reasonable for the price. 
22496,"Posted on May 6, 2024",Прекрасно!,"After using rose water, the skin smells delicious and looks better: it glows from the inside, its tone is evened out. The skin becomes soft and looks healthy. Instantly moisturizes and soothes the skin. The subtle aroma of fresh roses is almost inaudible and feels like high quality ingredients. One hundred percent satisfied
"
22496,"Posted on Apr 17, 2024",Makes my skin super soft,I highly recommend using rose water like this one to spray before applying any oils (i like sweet almond oil). It's a game changer because it gently hydrates the skin before the oil locks it in with its moisturizing benefit. Just make sure your skin is still wet with the rose water when you apply any oil after. 
22496,"Posted on Mar 21, 2024",Love ,First time purchase and would buy again. Beautiful and clean essence with just rose ingredient. Refreshing and natural scent. On the bottle it says use is for body and bath but I have been using for face with no allergic reactions. Packaged in a dark blue bottle to help keep product quality. I keep it by my bedside and use it daily. 
22496,"Posted on Mar 12, 2024",excellent toner,"this makes a wonderful facial toner or makeup setting spray-bear in mind, the sprayer is not a super fine mist, but it's not terrible either. you can always swap out the sprayer with another. the rose scent is perfect and natural, not too weak, not too strong. smells much better than that other brand that starts with an ""h"". the scent does not linger on your skin."
22496,"Posted on Jan 2, 2024",Energy spray!!!,Loved using this around my body like a protective spray. It cleansed my energy. I'm an energy healer so using this cleared me up quite well. It would be great on the skin too I imagine.

75786,"Posted on Oct 4, 2024",,"Texture is thick and heavy and hard to wash off so use sparingly(mid to ends only). Using too much might result in hair being limp, flat and heavy. But I absolutely love the scent and it leaves a beautiful fragrance on your hair after showering. I use it only once a week in place of my other conditioners as an intensive treatment to really condition and nourish my hair. My only gripe is the 250ml packaging as I always have a problem with opening and closing the cap. It's so tight for the first 2 weeks or so and then when I wanna close it, it's kinda out of alignment or there's a problem with the closing mechanism but it's always a struggle especially when your hands are wet and slippery. Improved the packaging and it'd be perfect! "

I didn't need to worry. The taste and quality are tops, and it being a loose tea means one can adjust it to what one needs and maybe drink the leftover tea the next day.  It's become a yearly purchase, which friends also enjoy. Even the best teabags can't compare with this."
30934,"Posted on Oct 7, 2024",Great Making Your Own Tea,"This is the second time that I have purchased a bag of these Chamomile Flowers.  The first bag lasted me a few years and the flowers were still fragrant and tasted sweet even after all that time.  I would make my own chamomile tea instead of buying it prepackaged from a store.  The tea would taste fresh and I have used it for pink eye itching.  You steep the tea in a tea bag that you can either reuse or dispose of, then apply the cool tea bag to your eyes.  It would help greatly reduce the itching and seemed to heal quicker.  As for steeping as a drinkable tea, I used a reusable tea infuser and I would drink or family members would drink it if they had stomach upset.  It always helped reduce the upset stomach.  Highly recommend this product!"

136219,"Posted on Sep 1, 2024",I wanted to like this,"For this particular colour, I wouldn't call this a tint. It's much heavier and more matte than you would infer from something called a 'lip tint'. Also, the packaging colour is wildly misleading in that the actual colour is much more towards a taupey-brown neutral as opposed to a raspberry or something. Don't get me wrong, however, this makes a great lip colour for those whose skin tones fit, and for those who want a heavier saturation bordering lipstick. It unfortunately doesn't suit me and is more intense than I want."

The color is rich and vibrant and contains the least amount of stems and leaves. With the abundance of flowers and buds, it's perfect for your loose teas (especially if you intend to make a tea with only lavender, not as a blend)"

First of all, it has a perfect warm brown tone, which I have yet to encounter in balms.  It spreads easily and evenly on the lips.  The size is small and easy to put in a bag  and use easily, even with no mirror.  Admittedly, the level of hydration is not the same as that of a therapeutic lipstick, but higher than a normal lipstick.  And the pigment level is high and good.  There is a light scent of coconut that is not very noticeable.  The color does not slide from the lips out.

I don't have curls so I don't know about that aspect of it. It doesn't have much of a scent of cherry blossoms or roses, just smells like plain shampoo. One thing, I don't naturally have dry hair, and it's a bit too moisturizing probably for my slightly oily scalp. If I didn't have such dry ends I would use something a bit more astringent. But if you have dry hair, for whatever reason, this will make it very soft."

The size of the bottle is generous and would last a long time, especially if you don't use it daily. While it claims multiple benefits like rose for calming and irritation relief, I can't speak to those specifically. However, the composition with mostly natural ingredients and the fact it's pH balanced is a big plus.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a full 5 stars is because the fragrance, while pleasant, isn't super strong. If you're looking for a powerful scent that fills the bathroom, this might not be it. Overall though, it's a great quality shower gel that would be a nice addition to anyone's shower routine, especially if you enjoy natural ingredients and a light, floral scent to relax you at the end of the day."

Celestial Seasonings' Sleepytime Peach Herbal Tea is a caffeine-free blend designed to help you relax, especially before bed. It builds on the classic Sleepytime blend with a light peach flavor, creating a soothing tea that is both fruity and herbal. Each box contains 20 tea bags, offering an affordable option for those seeking a natural way to unwind at the end of the day.

Taste and Flavor:

This tea strikes a balance between the sweet peach flavor and the calming herbal blend of chamomile, spearmint, and lemongrass. The peach is subtle, offering just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering the herbal notes. Chamomile is known for its calming effects, while spearmint adds a refreshing touch. Lemongrass brings a light, citrusy note, rounding out the flavor profile.

The tea’s flavor is mild and perfect for evening relaxation. It can be enjoyed without sweeteners, though adding honey can enhance the natural peach flavor. The combination of fruity and herbal elements makes for a comforting, soothing cup.

Aroma:

The aroma of the Sleepytime Peach Herbal Tea is gentle and inviting. The peach scent is prominent even before steeping, and once brewed, the tea releases a sweet, fruity fragrance blended with the soft herbal notes of chamomile and spearmint. The aroma alone helps create a calming atmosphere, making it a perfect tea to wind down with.

Brewing Experience:

This tea is quick and easy to brew, with a steep time of 4 to 6 minutes for optimal flavor. The peach aroma intensifies as the tea steeps, and the color turns a light golden hue. Even with longer steeping times, the tea remains smooth and never bitter.

While the tea bags are not individually wrapped, the packaging does a good job of preserving freshness if stored properly.

Health Benefits:

This caffeine-free tea is ideal for nighttime drinking. Chamomile, spearmint, and lemongrass are known for their relaxing properties, helping to ease stress and promote restful sleep. With no artificial flavors or preservatives, this low-calorie tea is a healthy alternative to sugary or caffeinated drinks.

Conclusion:

Sleepytime Peach Herbal Tea is a soothing, caffeine-free option for those looking to relax before bed. The gentle peach flavor complements the classic herbal blend, making it a great choice for anyone seeking a calming, natural way to end their day.

Pros:

Light peach flavor complements herbs
Caffeine-free and calming
No artificial flavors
Cons:

Peach flavor may be too subtle for some
Tea bags are not individually wrapped"

I tried different combinations and the effect is definitely perceptible in less than one hour: more clarity, more comfortable night and wake ups, wonderful trainings combined with tongkat 400 Mg in the afternoon, long lasting energy, better mood, nice arousal times and last but not least, a very deep relaxation level: the first time i ate this pill was awesome, my muscles and joints became so relaxed, not painful at all, i could push myself further and feel more confident  but when  i started to take 2 pills a day, morning and afternoon, my heart showed some uncomfortable symptoms. I also noticed a very interesting effect on inflamation levels, noticeably reduced, whatever the symptoms. I wish i had heard about this product earlier. 1 pill per day is enough, 2 might occasionally be used but definitely not with any other supplements containing yohimbine: from my experience - 47 years old -  the benefit should not become a health concern . More studies are required to ensure the safe composition dosage, for now, better to avoid quantities on long term i guess. i've read 1000 Mg Catuaba per day should be the maximum, but i think 500 Mg is already enough and very satisfaying.  Better to avoid taking in the evening because it can keep u awake for the rest of the night :)"

The melatonin gums are a good size and really seem like normal candy. 
I know they got kids as their target audience, but I bought them for myself because of the lower dose of melatonin. The gummies taste like bubble gum to me. 
I like the clean, quality ingredients of mostly fruit puree.
Even when only taking one, they make me super tired after about 1 hr of taking them.
The only downside for me is super vivid dreams, but I get this side effect with all melatonin products, so it doesn't take away from the amazing effect of the Smurf gummies. "

I love that it is natural and high quality product. The texture is light and doesn't give a white cast. This is now my favourite face sunscreen – I have tried quite a few natural ones but I think all the Babo Botanicals are beginning to be my favourite natural sunscreen products. I find the scent very light and it smells pleasant.  I use it daily and am now going to buy another! "
115656,"Posted on Sep 20, 2024",Worry free under the sun,"I always try my best to choose products with clean composition, and babo never fails.
Great to use everyday, it is tinted so will leave your skin with obvious white cast. Once you squeeze it out you have to immediately spread it because it dries fast but it is greasy. I love the packaging because you will not worry about it leaking or breaking since it is durable.

115656,"Posted on Feb 25, 2024",Great sunscreen!,"This is a great quality sunscreen and I love that it's organic and natural. The formula is really elegant for a natural product too. It's a very thin, sheer fluid that spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It's not drying and also not greasy or sticky. It's probably my new favorite. It does leave a very slight white cast. It has worked well under makeup for me. I'm glad I was able to find a high SPF organic sunscreen. That package is a little strange depending on how you like to apply sunscreen - it doesn't work great to dispense into your hands/fingers, it works best if you apply it directly to your face from the tube.

115656,"Posted on Nov 2, 2023",Excellent sun protection ,"As someone who’s always conscious of my skincare, I’m always looking out for the best sunscreen options that can protect my skin from harmful UV rays. Recently, I came across a Babo Botanicals mineral sunscreen fluid that not only has excellent sun protection, but also feels great on the skin.

The fluid is lightweight and absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving no greasy feeling behind. It has a subtle scent that's not overpowering, and the best part is that it comes in a generous 50ml size bottle, which means you get a lot of bang for your buck.

I've been using it every day for a few weeks now, and I can say with certainty that I'm definitely feeling the difference. My skin is protected from the sun's rays, and it also feels smoother and more moisturized. I highly recommend this sunscreen fluid to anyone looking for a practical and effective option for protecting themselves from UV damage."
115656,"Posted on Oct 21, 2023",Found my perfect sunscreen! ,"It’s a completely mineral sunscreen, high SPF. Because of the tint it doesn’t leave a white cast and it’s consistency and texture is so thin that one can actually wear the recommended amount of sunscreen we’re supposed to. Also it dries down and the finish is neither matte nor greasy which works great for my normal skin. 
I’ve been on a hunt for the perfect mineral sunscreen for years and now I’ve finally found one which I have no complaints with. "

The quality and ingredients are simple, clean for an SPF, non-irritating, and worth the price in my opinion. The package contains a bead inside of the bottle to shake the formula, and while the size is small, a little goes a long way. The formulation is quite runny so it applies evenly and doesn’t feel as heavy as other zinc oxide compositions. During paler months where this tint may be too dark for my complexion, I mix it with another light SPF for the perfect combo. I love this product and am so grateful to have something that doesn’t make my skin look ghostly and tacky. Highly recommended for my friends with more melanin!"

I can't believe it is spf 50 and doesn't have a white cast. incredible! 
115655,"Posted on May 2, 2024",Great face sunscreen,I really like this tinted face sunscreen from Babo botanicals. It’s comparable to the drunk elephant one but a little bit more sheer.

81487,"Posted on Nov 10, 2023",Coming back for more of this Toner,"Yeouth Retinol set had become a new beginning for my skin. I have a dry skin prone to wrinkles. 
The set contains the minimal amount of Retinol (2,5%), which is not irritating, but enough for the exfoliation and rejuvenation which Retinol is praised for. Plus Hyaluronic Acid( to locks moisture into the skin), Camomile, Aloe Vera, Ginseng, Green tea extracts, VItamin E ( they have calming and protecting  effects) 

At the beginning being afraid to burn my skin, I have mixed the eye cream and Retinol serum with some other serum, or eye cream for the eyes. Within a few days I realised that I could apply the serum and cream directly on the skin. No irritation now burns.

After two months I clearly see the benefits: the wrinkles are no longer deep and prominent. The skin has got an even tone and radian. There have been no pimples on my skin (Retinol does cure minor breakouts)

The procedure is as follows. Start with a Balancing toner. While the skin is still moistened with the toner apply the Retinol eye Cream around the eye and Retinol serum on the skin of the face, neck and décolleté, gently massage the ointments into the skin. Leave it to work on our skin for 10-20 minutes. Afterwards apply Retinol Moistorizer for moisturised comfortable watery skin sensation overnight. 
Rejuvenated overnight. Wash the face in the morning, and proceed with your usual day-time routine, plus sunscreen. 
 the Retinol serum will be probably enough  for  6 months. 
I love to apply a sick layer of the Moisturizer,  so the first 30ml lasted me only one month. And the Balancing Toner was enough for two months. 

Please remember that Retinol should only be used at night, and at the day time use a good 50+ sunscreen. 
Also, please don't combine Retinol with vitamin C skin treatment, or other exfoliants. "
81487,"Posted on Sep 23, 2024",Great for travel,"Great for overnight travel, but the size is too small to last very long, for me it was only three time use.

Now we buy more veggies at the farmers market because they last for over a week using these bags. Occassionally, I add paper towels in the bag to prevent moisture from forming. It is crucial to cool the fruits and veggies first before putting them in the bag. Helps to suck the air out of the bag too."

Ginger, which spoils easily once used, lasts three times longer when wrapped in a paper towel and placed in this bag. Although it’s a bit of a hassle to wash the bag and dry both the inside and outside after use, since it can be reused, it seems like it will take over six months to go through all ten bags. The included wire fasteners are difficult to use, so I secure the bags with different clips."

But, before placing your leafy greens in the bag, you have to wrap them in paper towels, however, and change the towels daily and regularly. You should also release the air completely before securing the bag. The only downside is that they don’t provide enough ties."

As advertised, the bags are sturdy and easy to clean. I’ve only used 2 of the bags since buying them about a month ago because I can simply rinse and reuse. There does also seem to be a difference in how long the produce from our garden lasts when compared to typical plastic bags, which is another reason this product may be a good choice. "

104506,"Posted on Sep 22, 2024",Not worth it,"I like Rishi green teas, but the herbal teas are not worth the price. They all mostly taste like hibiscus tea. Hibiscus is very inexpensive and can be bought in bulk. The taste of Rishi herbal teas is also pretty weak—more like Choice brand teas, which are much cheaper. I wouldn’t buy Choice’s green tea, but I will continue to buy their herbal teas.
I even like the Numi brand more than Rishi overall. Their green tea is the same quality, but their herbal teas have more flavor and are more distinct from each other. Plus, they are cheaper.
Rishi looks fancier and may look cool in your pantry, but overall it’s a waste of money for their herbal teas. I regret buying them, and I bought every one of their flavors."

81484,"Posted on Jul 31, 2024",Wow,"I recently tried the new Radiant Glow face cream, and overall, it's quite impressive. The size of the jar is generous, offering a good amount of product that should last a while. The packaging is sleek and modern, with a clean design that looks elegant on any vanity. 

In terms of quality, the cream is rich and hydrating without being greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth. The scent is subtle and pleasant, adding a touch of luxury to the daily routine without being overpowering. 

The cream is easy to use, and a little goes a long way. After a few weeks of use, my skin feels more nourished and radiant. This face cream is a great addition to any skincare regimen, offering both efficacy and a bit of indulgence."

81495,"Posted on Feb 13, 2024",,"This is an amazing glycolic acid peel with 30% potency. It is a mini size of 5ml for me to try. It has a very mild subtle green tea scent. As I have very oily skin, the tendency of having clogged congested pores are high. Thus using this mini home peel seem good for clearing my congested pores and also reducing blackheads and whiteheads from forming. It brightens the skin a bit. It exfoliates and smooths the rough skin as it takes away dead surface skin cells. After the peel, the face will look clearer and glowing, I would use my gentle hydrating moisturizer as the skin can be sensitive to anything that is acidic like vitamin c serum or retin A.

---

I've been using the YEOUTH Anti-Aging Super Serum, and it has made a significant difference in my skin. This serum is packed with Vitamin C & E, hyaluronic acid, and ferulic acid, which target signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles, free radical damage, and collagen loss. My complexion looks brighter and more vibrant, and my skin feels intensely hydrated, soft, and plump. The antioxidant protection helps fortify my skin and guard against photoaging. I love that YEOUTH products are engineered to work together, enhancing effectiveness for dramatically visible results. Using this serum has really boosted my confidence in my skin's appearance. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to combat aging signs and achieve a healthy glow!

82234,"Posted on Jul 5, 2024",Loved this product,"I have used the trial size and it has really made my skin look way more beautiful. I literally woke up with tighter and prettier skin when I used it. I liked the ingredient composition and the scent was a bit weird, reminded of citric acid, however it was okay."
82234,"Posted on Jul 2, 2024",I love it,"I love this for my dry skin. I use it in a morning before a makeup. It isn't too oily but keeps away from dryness. It contains Vitamin C and E so hoping to get benefits of anti-aging and Lightning.

the only thing I wasn't big fan of is a bottle. Too thick to come out from a pump."
82234,"Posted on Jun 17, 2024",Great serum,I am a woman of a certain age. I like to change products on my face and neck. I found this serum works well. It offers the benefit to my sensitive skin of reducing wrinkle emphasis. My skin seems smoother with frequent use of this product. I like the quality and feel that the size is fair for the quality and price. I will use again.
82234,"Posted on Jun 12, 2024",Top quality ingredients ,I bought 2 as they were on sale. These are tiny trial size and tiny in package. The benefit was experienced immediately.

This blueberry hibiscus tea is one of my favorites I add to the blend frequently. It is caffeine free and it adds a very slight sweet taste. It is also very tasty when used on it’s own. The tea is high quality actual tea leaves, not powdery. The tea comes in separate envelopes and in a very elegant silky sachet, not the paper like tea bag, very fancy."

61843,"Posted on Dec 26, 2023","Expensive, but delicious!","I had never tried this brand before, but even though expensive the ingredients in this tea blend sounded too good to not try. And after trying it I can say they really are that good! I love this tea. It's expensive, but if you are careful to not make your first cup of tea full strength, you can get 2 cups out of the same tea bag. Still delicious at the weaker strength. The tea bags are really unique, in shape and material, and hold up very well to the 2nd use.  The taste is great, really nice with some honey it in too. I think the ingredients are all high quality, I love that it's organic. It's so nice that I would trust other tea blends this company makes too if the ingredients appeal to me. It seems the company has a commitment to quality. "

This is a great blend of blueberry and hibiscus and very flavorful, comes in tea bag so easy to steep. I use a German Rock Sugar when I can find it but this has a good taste even if you do not sweeten it. I prefer tea sweet but sometimes I do not sweeten my teas. I would suggest this tea, if you are tea lover like we are I think you will enjoy this tea. "

61843,"Posted on Sep 22, 2024",Not worth the price tag,"I like Rishi green teas, but the herbal teas are not worth the price. They all mostly taste like hibiscus tea. Hibiscus is very inexpensive and can be bought in bulk. The taste of Rishi herbal teas is also pretty weak—more like Choice brand teas, which are much cheaper. I wouldn’t buy Choice’s green tea, but I will continue to buy their herbal teas.
I even like the Numi brand more than Rishi overall. Their green tea is the same quality, but their herbal teas have more flavor and are more distinct from each other. Plus, they are cheaper.
Rishi looks fancier and may look cool in your pantry, but overall it’s a waste of money for their herbal teas. I regret buying them, and I bought every one of their flavors."
61843,"Posted on Sep 9, 2024",Nice flavor complicated packaging,The box is huge and takes a lot of space in a small kitchen. The flavor of the ingredients is nicely fruity and warm. The single packaging of the teabags is complicated even though they say it’s compostable.

If you want SUPER Bergamot-flavored tea, Stash makes a Double Earl I recommend. What this will taste like is a super smooth, very high quality Earl with a little bit of vanilla. I had it with some milk, sugar and paired it with mini cinnamon sugar donuts, simply amazing. If you can’t drink coffee anymore but miss the nice, smooth flavor, I feel like this will satisfy your craving. 30 tea bags is a decent deal for the price, plus you could use the cute tin for something like buttons, beads, pet treats, or even a plant."

Iced, hot, or even lukewarm, I'm likely lovingly addicted (had 3 tins so far, just ordered 2 more in my cart as I type).

The satchel quality is that pyramidal high end satchel, and while I don't have every day, when I need to wake up early now it's a favorite.

The quality of this tea is great. It smells amazing and tastes good. When you shake the tea bag above your hand - nothing falls off, which means this is a good quality tea.
It’s not expensive and you do get a lot of tea from it, so I recommend it!

I got this for an amazing price and I think it’s worth it. You get an absolutely huge bottle (see picture) with pure centella, which is a healthy, gentle ingredient for the skin in order to reduce inflammation and redness. The size is huge for this, so you can use it in the mornings for a long time. 
Give it a try, it’s really worth a shot.

The tin is beautifully designed and airtight to keep leaves fresh. It seems to be a good quality and I appreciate the fact the ingredients are organic."

Prepare yourself for a proper cup of Earl Grey, every cup, whether you purchase the sachets or the loose leaf tea. This Earl Grey has a bright, unwavering note of bergamot balance nicely with a clear, clean black tea that's not overpowering, just brisk. The flavor lasts as you sip, reminding me of some favorite Chinese teas, strong, but not that heavy, muddy taste you find in cheaply produced teas. I am a huge Earl Grey fan, and, so far, this is my absolute favorite. If you like the clean, bright, balanced tannins and bergamot in Earl Grey, you will love this tea. Harney and Sons nailed it, and I recommend it without reservation."

Unique scent of the dry leaves does not fully come out in the brew, but it's great nonetheless. I do notice some tiny twigs in the canister, but they are such a similar size to the larger, high quality rolled leaves, that they would probably need to be hand-sorted to fully avoid. still worth it in my opinion."

80515,"Posted on Nov 23, 2023",Great tast,"I had bought Teddy's crunchy peanut butter for years and liked it just fine, but I recently decided to try the Peanut Butter & Co. brand. I like that its only ingredients are peanuts and salt -- but tastewise, it's not over-salted, which is good if you're into low sodium products. Tastewise, overall, it's has a lovely mild flavor. Some natural peanut butters seem harsh to me. The only issue I have with all natural peanut butters is the puddle of oil floating on top, which means it's soupy. You have to give it a brisk long stir. I went online for other solutions which suggested storing it upside down in the fridge after stirring. Trying that -- we'll see. P.S. Upside down storage in the fridge worked. Yay!
The quality of this peanut better is better then any other peanut butter product I’ve tried."
80515,"Posted on Nov 20, 2023",Favorite from this brand,This is one my favorite from this brand (please see other reviews on other products) because it is simply peanuts and salt.

Great for sandwiches, baking, or straight from the jar!"

9773,"Posted on Sep 21, 2024","the best tea in my personal opinion, hands down","Perfect packaging that keeps moisture away, high quality ingredients that promise a great taste with each use.
The size of each tea bag is pretty big, and it's caffeine free, so you can let it simmer in a small teapot (0.7l, 1 teabag, or 1.7l, 2 teabags) all you like.
I suggest adding a milk of your choice and a bit of sugar, or even better - honey, before serving. 
Great blend of spices and tastes, and the only Chai I tried that is very close in how it tastes to the actual spice blend of Chai masala (if you buy it in health/spice stores), just way easy to use. 
The only tea I keep buying more from each time I finish it.

The cinnamon provided a comforting warmth, while the ginger added a subtle zing. The cloves lent a touch of complexity, rounding out the overall taste.

The only downside for me personally is the price, but if you can afford it then by all means go for it! Big thumbs up for all their products being certified organic! The amount of pesticides being used out there is very alarming, and their residue can enter ground and surface waters like rivers and streams that people and wildlife use for drinking and also harms aquatic life along the way. So you risk exposing yourself to contaminants every time you use a product that is not certified organic. Organic is by no means perfect but it is a big step forward to stopping this sad and terrible cycle. Please 👍 if you found this helpful! 🌼"

This one in particular has some great ingredients and, while the up front cost might seem a little steep, the bottle will last you ~3 months if you stick to 1 tbsp per day. I'm also a big fan of the amber glass bottle and it's general aesthetic. I'm usually skeptical of antioxidant blends like this since it's tough to credit any benefits to a particular ingredient, so I'll just say that I remain in good health in writing this review despite my questionable dietary/lifestyle choices in the past. I trust the quality of the ingredients, the brand, and considering the size of the bottle, I'll be keeping this in my arsenal as long as they continue making it."

I just tried the white oil on a french fry (YES, YOU CAN LAUGH, but wait 'til you try it) and the white does have a STRONGER mushroom/truffle presence. NOT OVERWHELMING or spicy, but HEAVENLY.

So if there was a bechamel, bland sauced item....BLACK TRUFFLE OIL. However, if the food has a stronger flavor (ALFREDO), I would go with white, so it stands up to the garlic/parmesan and brings smiles to all who eat.

They have a satisfying crunch and a savory flavor that pairs perfectly with various toppings or on their own. The rosemary adds a subtle herbal note that complements the nuttiness of the almond flour, while the salt enhances the overall taste without being overpowering. They are also gluten-free, which makes them a great option for those with dietary restrictions. Overall, they are a tasty and enjoyable snack that I would definitely recommend."
75282,"Posted on Oct 3, 2024",Nice gluten free crackers,"RATING: 👍🏻	
8/10

TASTE: 👍🏻
The rosemary sea salt flavor is nice and feels natural. It’s not too strong so you can east those with cheese or a dip but it’s strong enough so you could enjoy them as it, just plain (like I did).

I did find them a bit too salty and wouldn’t have mind a stronger rosemary flavor. 

TEXTURE: 👍🏻
Those square shaped crackers are quite thin and have a nice crunchy but could have been a bit crispier as those get mushy as you chew them. 

I might try another flavor next time. "

It can keep the crunchy texture for a long time.

The girls in Hawaii would use it in their hair and the girls in California would wear it all over! It has a lovely, nostalgic smell. It's a beautiful floral and not overpowering. It's not full-force outward gardenia but it's an authentic floral and one of the better quality ones. It even has flower petals!  It's one you can use some dabs of as a perfume, or whole body making it also great for massage. You can mix it with a little more coconut oil to cut the scent if desired.
Due to it being 99% coconut oil, be warned it's tempurature sensitive and prone to some clumping or hardening just like any coconut oil. 
It will soften with the warmth of your hands, sun, or if you soak the bottle in some hot water. Do not microwave.

You can comfortable enjoy these as a snack with a glass of milk. 
75291,"Posted on Mar 18, 2024",Gluten free treat,"Nice crumbly cookie with loads of chocolatey goodness. I like that they use nut and seed flour, which gives the cookies a richer, and of course slightly nuttier, flavour. Because they don't use grain flour, they're slightly more keto-friendly, but still use sugar, so they have more carbs than a strictly keto cookie. But they are definitely tasty!"
75291,"Posted on Feb 23, 2024",Excellent,"Lately I found myself addicted to almond flour made biscuits, there is something about the crunchiness of biscuits that are made by almond flour. It's not that it's just crunchy but also it's kind of soft crunchiness that is rather rare you would get to experience it from other biscuits and I am surprised the cookies are just as good if not better than the biscuit. The chocolate is just about right, not too much, not too little and most importantly, it's not sweet like it's full of sugar. Definitely will make another purchase."

What I appreciate most is the smooth flavor—it's not bitter like some other green teas I've had. The taste is refreshing and soothing, making it perfect for any time of day.

As for the energy boost, I’ve noticed a significant difference since incorporating this tea into my routine. Unlike coffee, it provides a gentle lift without the jitters. I feel more focused and alert, which helps me power through my workday.

Overall, I highly recommend this green tea to anyone looking for a high-quality option that not only tastes great but also offers a natural energy boost. It’s become an essential part of my daily ritual!"

The leaves, rolled like pearls, add an elegant touch to the experience. While the packaging is adorable and reusable, the quantity provided falls short of expectations, and the serving size is notably less than advertised. Admittedly, it's on the pricier side, but the quality of ingredients speaks volumes. Overall, despite minor setbacks in quantity and serving size, the exquisite taste and premium ingredients make it a worthwhile indulgence for tea enthusiasts."
37940,"Posted on Oct 2, 2024",Fragrant jasmine scented tea - won’t go back to regular jasmine loose tea after trying these pearls!,"Wow, what a stunning and fragrant tea that needs absolutely no sugar or other additives to shine! I used to love regular jasmine tea that is sold as loose leaves, but since switching to these higher quality pearls, there’s no way I’m going back to the loose leaf jasmine tea. The pearls expand significantly in water, so I would advise to not overuse or overfill with tea pearls — it doesn’t look like enough tea when you first put the recommended serving size in the pot, but they expand over 4 minutes, so don’t do what I did and way overfill the leaves. This tea shines most when steeped in bottled water (not tap - I’ve tried both and tap gives it a mineral aftertaste), and when steeped in exactly 175 degree water, not boiling. Plus, the adorable little lid inside the package keeps the tea super fresh.  "

Whether enjoyed hot or cold, this tea never fails to elevate my tea-drinking experience.

But everytime I use this I can see that my under eye is brighter and very moisturized. So I highly recommend this if your under eyes are dark. How I use it is I used it as the last step of my skincare- kind of like a mask that locks everything in. I use it until it's completely dry, so about an hour. Some downsides are that when it's wet, it slides down my face quite easily, it doesn't have a really good grip on the skin, and the size/design of the eye patch is a little bit odd for the eyes, but maybe because it's multifunctional-  not only for the eyes but also you can use it for the smile lines or the forehead lines.

The glycolic acid gently exfoliates, leaving my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, and less prone to breakouts. My complexion has become noticeably clearer and more balanced since I started using it. If you have oily skin, this cleanser is definitely worth trying!"

This cleanser is gentle on my sensitive skin but I can feel how smooth it is right after the washing. The cleanser doesn't lather, and I use it after I removed my makeup, as it doesn't do that. A little goes a long way and the bottle lasts me easily a few months."

It smoothens my bumps, and high quality for its price (I bought it when it was on 50% discount)"
5077,"Posted on Nov 25, 2023",Great product,"This product cleanses the face really well while also having some exfoliating effect. It doesn't foam much but gets the job done effectively with glycolic acid, I guess, being the main reason for it. But while glycolic acid brings many benefits to the delicate face skin, it also removes the top layer of skin cells thus leaving the cells underneath more vulnerable to sun damage which is the only con of the product. Overall, the composition is good and well-balanced and the cleanser is gentle on the skin. "

The product selection is vast, from supplements to beauty care, and the prices are competitive. Shipping is fast, and the product information is detailed, making it easy to choose the right items. The only minor inconvenience is with payments—due to certain regulations, our bank only accepts dollar transfers from Chinese banks. I assume this is to keep money inside the country, which is a bit frustrating, but nothing to do with iHerb itself. Their customer service is responsive, and I've had no issues with orders.

4428,"Posted on Aug 22, 2024",Love the scent and quality,"This shampoo has changed my hair for the better. I went from a constantly itchy, dandruffy scalp to normal, shiny hair. I have had family members compliment my hair lately and ask what I'm doing differently. Plus, my hair seems to be growing SO much faster (I have a bead braid in my hair that has grown out over an inch in two months - they typically last much longer before I have to take them out). I've been fighting with my hair for my entire life and I finally have relief.

A warning though, this shampoo can be very drying if you overuse it. This shouldn't be a surprise if you look at the active ingredient, which is also a common acne medicine. If you are an every day hair washer, this is not for you. I use it about every 2-3 days (showering with no shampoo in between), and my hair has never looked & felt better. Couple it with a good conditioner for the ends of your hair and you will be in business.

So often, I find that natural / organic products fail to get the job done and hide behind the concept of being earth friendly.  It's not the case with this shampoo.  It works on both my wife's long hair as well as my crew cut.  The only thing not very natural about it is the packaging (I wish there was a refill bag, or a larger bottle), but that's my only criticism.  Brilliant shampoo!"
49122,"Posted on Nov 28, 2023",Pleasant cinnamon flavor and freshness!,I’ve tried a variety of tooth pastes and keep coming back to this brand. It’s cleansing and leaves my mouth tasting fresh and my teeth clean but does not seem to cause dry mouth. The toothpaste is more soft and can tend to ooze out of the toothpaste container easily. One thing I’ve learned to help conserve the toothpaste and avoid waste is to only peel back half of the foil cover on the toothpaste container and screw the top back on once you first open the tube. Works so much better and much less mess.

I was pretty excited about it because, you know, natural ingredients and all that. But here's the thing – it didn't go so well. After using it for a while, I started noticing some skin irritation and red marks on my face. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but then I realized it was probably from the toothpaste. Turns out, it contains COQ-10, which can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin, especially if you're not careful while brushing. I think I might have accidentally left some toothpaste on the outside of my mouth while brushing, which caused the irritation. Lesson learned, I guess – always rinse thoroughly!

This serum has a vitamin c derivative which is good for acne and is also more stable. It has a thick milky consistency, but absorbs immediately into the skin. It has a very mild citrusy smell, which works for me despite having rosacea and extremely sensitive skin. I find this serum very moisturizing and it makes my skin glowy. I use it under sunscreen every morning, since vitamin c is known to enhance the effectiveness of sunscreen. It's too soon to tell if it helps me with pigmentation though. the serum contains vitamin c, vitamin e and ferulic acid which is a powerful combination, which doubles the UV protection abilities of the formula. If this review helped you, please give it a like ;)"

41598,"Posted on Sep 9, 2024","Good quality for sensitive skin, but has disadvantages ","Used for normal sensitive skin, 25 years old

Advantages:

1) Easy to apply
2) nice scent and texture
3) good quality 
4) 1 bottle is enough for 2 months (generously applying once daily)
5) gently for sensitive skin, I started to apply for few drops to let my skin get used to it
6) good package, easy to use

Disadvantages

1) if apply too much, the serum will rolls off the skin when touching the skin, which is annoying, because it happens when you apply cream over serum
2) not oily and feels a bit dry

Overall recommend to try, especially for sensitive skin

7/10

TASTE: 👍🏻
The cheddar flavor was okay but didn’t feel strong enough and there was a slightly odd taste maybe coming from the beans or veggies those crackers are made of.

They’re quite salty but feel rather healthy and natural.

From the moment I steeped the first tea bag, I was captivated by the warm, inviting aroma of caramel wafting through the air. Each sip is a gentle embrace of silky caramel notes, harmoniously blended with the tea's calming herbs. The caffeine-free nature ensures that my evening ritual is undisturbed, allowing for a peaceful transition into a restful night's sleep. The 16 tea bags are perfectly portioned, ensuring consistent flavor and potency with each brew. What's truly commendable is the subtle sweetness of the caramel, which is never overpowering but just right, providing a comforting backdrop to the tea's natural ingredients. It's evident that a lot of thought and care went into crafting this blend. For anyone seeking a tranquil end to their day, Bedtime's Soothing Caramel tea is the perfect companion.

This one is my absolute favourite and I buy it all the time. It does exactly what it's supposed to - it relaxes me and makes me sleepy almost right away. I think it's because of the poppy plant extract, which you rarely find in other brands' sleep blends. Plus, the taste is super pleasant with no synthetic flavours or fragrances. If you're like me and love a big mug of tea, I'd suggest using two tea bags because one might be too weak. Enjoy!"

While some other brands provide Freeze-Dried Adrenal and Herb Activators in separate products, this product ingredients combine them in a capsule, which is more convenient for using, and more cost-effect too.
After some trials and body monitors, I found the dosage of two capsules in the morning and one capsule in late afternoon is the most appropriate dosage for me. During the trials, I also found its is better to take the capsule with glass of water, and about one hour before meal. Luckily, the capsule has pleasant taste of natural herb instead of bovine!

45813,"Posted on Apr 12, 2024",Love it!,"My two year old loves this toothpaste. I chose this because the ingredients are all natural and children don’t need to rinse their mouth after using it. My boy uses this since he was 10 months old as first toothpaste, and he still loves it. He also loves the crocodile illustration on the package( he calls it “crocodile toothpaste “). 
I’ve been thinking that to change the toothpaste to the one for older kid since my boy became to able to rinse his mouth with water, but because he loves this so much(can’t find his favorite in pharmacy stores around home, Japan…), and I want this to be the first toothpaste for my daughter, I’ll keep buying it for next two or three years.

70034,"Posted on Oct 9, 2024",Fixed my period,"My gynecologist recommended me to take Vitex twice a day to fix my irregular period (It was usually regular but suddenly i missed some periods here and there) and to help with some functional ovarian cysts I had. I have been taking these supplements for 8 months now, and my period became regular again just after one month of taking them. I do not get super inflamed acne anymore before my period, and my cramps have become less painful. I have recently started taking magnesium as well and the combination of both has truly helped my mood swings during my lutheal phase and the last time i had my period i didn't even need to take a pain killer for it ( i used to have terrible cramps before). I highly recommend this brand! Look into these supplements before considering going for the pill ( took it for 2 years for the same problems i am taking Vitex for, and it actually made me feel worse)."

70034,"Posted on Jan 25, 2024","Good, but be careful not to take during and 14 days after your period","This substance gives a little boost to mood and energy! Be careful not to take it at the beginning of your cycle, as it mimics progesterone. Without being careful, I took it  one capsule for only 5 days after my period (beginning of cycle). A few weeks later, I had short, scanty periods and light bleeding for days. It's best to use it after ovulation and before menstruation. Because progesterone inhibits the effect of estrogen at the beginning of the cycle and can therefore interfere with ovulation!"

The texture is a bit gritty, but that’s to be expected with a product that uses whole food ingredients. It blends well with water or a milk alternative, though I prefer it with almond milk for extra creaminess.

One of the key benefits is the inclusion of a diverse range of plant-based proteins and digestive enzymes, which helps with satiety and digestion.

My daughter, who is now 11, didn't care for the taste. She had some sweeter vitamins once or twice, and now her taste buds a re changing :/. I do adore this company, though, and have relied on them and trusted their products ever since becoming a Mama. I also use their products for myself from time to time, as needed. Overall, we loved these vitamins for my son and will continue to purchase high quality supplements from Garden of Life!!! Thanks!"

Based on similar words from my nutritionist, I chose this product for my son. One of the few complexes that she trusts. I am also a supporter of mono-compositions, but this product is a cool exception. For a natural composition, it has a pleasant taste (not wildly sweet). My son eats it with pleasure.

5958,"Posted on Jul 29, 2024",Helped reduce heart palpitations,"This is just one person‘s experience, but ever since I’ve been taking one dropper full of this every day in the morning, it has helped me almost completely eradicate heart palpitations.
I asked a friend who is an accomplished herbalist if it’s safe to take every day and she said yes.
I would always prefer to use something homeopathic, or herbal rather than an allopathic strong drug. It’s still important to recognize that herbal medicine is medicine, and some should only be taken for a short period of time.
I had taken an online herbal course on remedies for heart health and the one thing every one of the experts agreed on was Hawthorne extract. There were other things they mentioned, but this seems to be the safest  choice.
So far, I’m very happy with it, and the quality of the product is excellent.
I suggest keeping it in the fridge.

Unfortunately, these issues appear at night while lying awake. And making a tea or drinking a tincture with a lot of alcohol is not handy then as the sleeping issues are also connected to liver problems.
Luckily, Nature's Answer now has a composition available which contains no alcohol at all and can easily be taken even at night. The taste is nice, kind of sweetish, and I feel some direct improvement when taking it. Furthermore, it is also said that to a certain extend hawthorn also supports healthy sleeping.

I also once watched a show on heart health that interviewed the most well respected herbalist, and all of them agreed that they would take for strengthening the heart is Hawthorne.
I have a fairly sensitive constitution, especially when it comes to any sort of medicine, whether herbal, homeopathic, or pharmaceutical. I have not had one concerning incident with this tincture in year and a half of taking it daily.
The company makes a fabulous product and I trust the brand
When it comes to herbs, with the exception of a few, like olive leaf, I generally take the tincture as it’s a concentrated, fresher way of using an herb.
If you do that, you might want to keep it in the side of the fridge as it will last indefinitely that way. "

But this has helped me, i used to use aluminum containing deodorant and it caused darkening of underarms, after switching to this, they lightened up

it helps with the smell but you will still sweat, so there will be the sweat stains. it does get onto black clothes and leaves a stain tho, but it can be washed off"

28915,"Posted on Mar 13, 2024",Great flavor-right strongness ,"I've started actively buying teas from the NUMi brand after trying their jasmine tea, which surprised me with its aroma and perfect taste. I really enjoy their Earl Grey Tea because it has a subtle, pleasant aroma, just as it should be in my opinion. The only issue, of course, is that the tea tends to have a diuretic effect on me, which means I visit the ladies' room more often. But overall, it's one of the best tea brands for me at the moment because I mainly drink black tea, green tea, and occasionally Rooibos, and all these flavors in this brand suit me. So, I mostly drink this tea now and reorder when I run out."
28915,"Posted on Nov 2, 2023",Love the Numi Teas!,"I’ve enjoyed trying a variety of organic Earl Gray teas from different brands and this one from Numi is really good, and high quality. I’m not sure if being that it is aged Earl Grey that the usual bright bergamot flavor of Earl Grey is more subtle, deeper and complex here in this organic blend. I found the tea flavorful and well rounded. I did not find it to be bitter even though I can sometimes tend to leave my tea steeping for way long than it’s supposed to! "
28915,"Posted on Aug 21, 2024",Favorite earl gray,This is my favorite earl gray tea.  I love the Numi tea brand.  The only thing I don't like is that they've switched to lining the inside of the tea bags with foil like material. I liked the old one better because I could recycle or compost them.

They said it's one of the best earl grey tea they've ever drank. I wonder if Numi could provide bigger pack as 18 tea bags in a pack is still a bit small and we have to buy multiple packs.
28915,"Posted on Apr 2, 2024",Nice aroma!,"Addicting to this Earl Grey tea! Top quality & good ingredients! To me the taste is milder than Marks & Spencer Earl Grey tea but it has its own uniquely bergamot flavour, I normally put 2 tea bags in a tea pot for better taste & it does help my digestion process a lot!

28915,"Posted on Nov 19, 2023",Absolutely the very best Aged Earl Grey tea ever!, Earl Grey tea is one of my favorites in life along with Chamomile tea.

Highly recommend this brand from iHerb.
28915,"Posted on Oct 18, 2023",The best organic Earl Grey tea,Earl grey is my favorite black tea and Numi's Aged Earl Grey is by far my favorite earl grey. It's a smooth black tea with the perfect amount of bergamot flavor. And I love that it's organic so I know there aren't any chemicals floating in my tea cup. This is a great price for the quantity. 
28915,"Posted on May 25, 2024",Good quality tea but not exceptional,I'm a big fan of Numi's teas and I drink a lot of Earl Grey from different brands. Numi teas are generally good quality though a little on the expensive side. I liked that this was organic but I won't say either the scent or taste of the brew is especially strong though this was supposed to be aged. I still prefer Harney and Sons Earl Grey Imperial though that's not organic.

If it's fairly mild, I find 1 tablet is enough to relieve those symptoms, this is my first go-to for stress relief. If it's extreme, I take 2 tablets and also pair it with ashwagandha (an adaptogen) & l-theanine and I also use flower essences (FES five flowers and/or post-trauma stabilizer). I also drink calming herbal tea with chamomile & passionflower every day. Everything in between I just dose based on my feeling of what will help.

The 1 mg dose is gentle, allowing for flexibility in adjusting to the right amount without feeling overly groggy the next day. I appreciate the instant dissolve format, which melts quickly under the tongue, providing quicker absorption than traditional pills. Overall, it's a great choice for those looking for a mild, effective sleep aid that works fast and is easy to take.







"
42422,"Posted on Aug 21, 2024",Great,They are very tiny tablets and they melt so quickly under the tongue so it is very easy to take without water. It works very fast like about 30mins after taking them. There is no side effect so far but still I am trying not to take them too much or too often. I take them only when I really cannot fall asleep and whenever I take them it makes me fall asleep in no time. 
42422,"Posted on Jul 26, 2024",Чудово!,Our Instant Dissolve MicroLingual Tablets may be small but they are full potency! Typical tablets and capsules need to be swallowed and are inefficiently absorbed in the digestive system. MicroLingual tablets dissolve immediately under the tongue heading straight into the body. Our proprietary hydrodrying process results in fewer inactive binders and fillers and a higher ratio of nutritional ingredients—hence the small size. They efficiently provide your body with the nutrients you need right now.
42422,"Posted on Apr 28, 2024",Best melatonin I've tried,"These sublingual tablets work quickly for me without leaving me with a hangover in the morning. I take two under my tongue when I struggle to fall asleep, or if I wake in the early hours and can't get back to sleep. I've tried any types, including capsules and slow release, and these work best for me. They are good value, and I can adjust the dose between one and two tablets, depending on how I'm feeling. They have a slightly sweet and gritty taste, which is not at all unpleasant. "
42422,"Posted on Apr 3, 2024",surprisingly efficient ,this 1 mg works just as well for me as the higher dosage options.  sublinguals are a great way to get nutrients into the bloodstream since you are bypassing the digestion process.  the pills are small and dissolve somewhat quickly.  sometimes it helps to move the tablet around with your tongue to help break it down fully

It used to take at least an hour for him to fall asleep, now I give this to him before he brushes his teeth or sometimes earlier. I would say it takes about 15-20 minutes to fully kick in and he just calms right down and passes out.

I’ve noticed a gentle calming effect without causing drowsiness, though it was more subtle than I hoped for. It works well, but I was expecting a bit more noticeable relaxation.

It's bad, like bad, bad, however, I put the full dropper in a half full shot glass of water and then drank it down in one swallow.

The ingredients are high quality and Herb Pharma is a great, reliable company to buy from. The taste isn't terrible and I just diluted it in a little water.

109129,"Posted on Mar 29, 2024",Nice,"Very watery and runny blush, great for “no makeup look”. The scent is pleasant, it smells like summer! 
I got the shade cherry and I expected it to be more red but it is actually leaning towards very bright pink. It’s very sheer so don’t get intimidated by the initial drop, it blends easily. Easy to use but I find that if you apply it directly onto the cheek it can leave a blank patch in the spot where you put the drop of the product. My advise would be applying it on your hand first and then go in with a dense blush brush. Or you can always use your fingers. The quality is good and it will last you a long time as you do not need much to get desired look. "
109129,"Posted on Feb 9, 2024",good,A'Pieu is my favorite brand! This blush is watery and you have to blend it nicely. It stays. It is buildable. at first i find it hard to use it correctly but after 2/3 times I understand how to blend it properly. packaging is very cute. Beautiful color.

First of all, the packaging is so cute and fun, it’s like a nail polish but I really like the idea of it and the applicator brush is easy to use. The blusher itself goes on so so smooth and is easy to blend. It’s not a heavy cream consistency, it’s more lightweight. You can make it look very natural or keep applying layers to get it to look very pigmented. I love the shade I got too, perfect for a natural flush look or a more red blushed look. It doesn’t have a scent, quality is great especially for the affordable price. I enjoy it more than other high end blushed I have. "

97567,"Posted on Mar 13, 2024",Superb ,"This hair mask is just amazing. This brand belongs to the natural, organic category. And I've been purchasing products from organic companies for some time now, realizing they are worth the attention. As for this mask, it's simply superb. My hair was dry and damaged after using and testing various other products for two weeks, which didn't quite suit me. This mask helped revive my hair from the very first use. And it's no wonder because it's packed with a huge amount of oils: coconut, castor oil, mango oil; keratin, and protein. This mask nourishes, restores, and moisturizes. Thanks to the person who invented it. Ha-ha. I'll definitely send a package to my mom from iHerb and include this mask so she can enjoy it too. I'm already on my third mask from this brand, and I'm simply satisfied with all of them. this mask is my number one. I've been actively promoting it on my Instagram, so the number of reviews on iHerb speaks for itself. I simply join the enthusiastic reviews about this product."

This is honestly hands down, the best hair mask I have ever tried! I have long, fine, colour treated hair and struggle with damage, dryness and split ends. This mask smells heavenly, like a mix between mango and vanilla. It's thick, and you get A TON of product for the price. I like to use this mask a little differently then recommended, I put it in a leave it for 30 minutes - overnight and the results are AMAZING! I can comb through my hair without detangler, its soft and smooth and doesn't feel weighed down. If you're on the fence about trying it, do it! Just don't be too upset when you don't want to use any other hair mask or conditioner...its literally the only thing I've used as a conditioner/hair mask for the last year.

I take one or two. It seems to have helped a lot. I've been using it for about 2 years now. I have tried the chewable one but I don't really like the fruit flavour so the capsules are better for me. Doesn't have any negative side effects for me at all.  I do not take them every day, only as needed . Package lasts a long time . My naturopath said this brand is really good quality, even though it's not the most expensive option."

He also uses 5-htp (for serotonin production) and both aids in relaxation and sleep."

Taking the recommended dosage a couple of times, I can't really say that it did much of anything. As an alcohol extract, you get that strong taste of alcohol if you try it directly under your tongue, with a mild flowery aftertaste.

48191,"Posted on Jan 26, 2024",For disrupted sleep and anxiety,Valerian is my go to herb for anxiety and disrupted sleep. Menopause is causing me to wake up far too early and makes me tired. Valerian helps me sleep better - it improves my sleep quality as well as making it easier to get off to sleep. I soak the capsules in water for a few hours and then drink half and hour before bed. I read this enhances their effect. They smell but this is the smell of good quality valerian. However taking capsules with water is easy and tasteless. The quality is excellent and price is fair. I tried other brands but this one gets me off to sleep the best. My understanding is that Valerian for sleep and anxiety works better taken as pure plant - as this capsule ingredient is (not tincture in alcohol as tincturing affects the properties of the plant). Also capsules are easy to travel with - I taken when travelling so I can sleep better en route and adjust better to time change and recover better from jet lag/ tiredness.

First, alongside my melatonin supplements, I sleep like a baby and have wonderful dreams. Second, Valerian Acid triggers a special kind of deep sleep, called Slow-Wave Deep Sleep, during which the anterior pituitary gland in the brain releases a polypeptide called Somatotropin. Somatotropin stimulates the growth of new cartilage, cartilage being what cushions and lubricates our joints. So, if you are taking Undenatured Collagen II and Glucosamine, taking a valerian tablet an hour before bed will round out your joint therapy strategy."

Also pairs really with passion flower and wild lettuce for a good nights sleep. This is from my personal experience. Always ask a medical professional before consuming or blending herbs. "

48643,"Posted on Jun 16, 2024","Really works like ashwaghanda, but has more of a buzz","I would say that my experience of rhodiola is positive. It definately helps me manage stress, improves sleep and concentration, and helps my overall mental and physical tolerance. However, I notice all these benefits, some more pronounced, with ashwaghanda. I think this is why rhodiola has fallen by the wayside in recent years. What I find is that rhodiola had a sharper boosting effect which is borderline stimulant-like. I also find is stimulates my bowl like a strong morning coffee does. I am not sure what the mechanism of action is, but there certainly seems to be an edge from this stuff.  Solgar is well known for producing very high quality ingredients. The dosage is reasonable, but the amount of capsules for the money paid could be much better. Altogether a 'decent' size for the money paid."

In comparison to the other rhodiola capsules I took this one had a much more distinctive taste. I don't want to discourage others because rhodiola as a tincture helps me tremendously - but from this particular capsule I really didn't notice a difference in my cortisol levels.

Rhodiola rosea is a medicinal plant in the Rhodiola genera (Crassulaceae family) which has traditionally been used as an anti-fatigue agent and adaptogen compound. he root contains a number of bioactive compounds, but the main two that are thought to mediate its effects are rosavin and salidroside. Rhodiola supplements are generally taken in the form of root powder or standardized extracts with 1–5% salidroside. Although Rhodiola supplements are usually taken for their stress-and fatigue-reducing effects, they may also have antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Acute usage of Rhodiola for fatigue and anti-stress has been noted to be taken in the 288-680 mg range.

As someone who has struggled with occasional insomnia and restlessness, I've tried all sorts of sleep supplements over the years. But these melatonin gummies with added 5-HTP have been a total game-changer for me. 

I take 4 of these gummies about 30 minutes before bedtime, and they do an incredible job of helping me fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly through the night.

The melatonin helps regulate my circadian rhythms and promotes that natural sleepy feeling, while the 5-HTP boosts serotonin production to relax my mind and body. I find that taking 4 gummies gives me the optimal effects without feeling groggy or hungover in the morning.

Beyond just the sleep benefits, I've also noticed an improvement in my overall mood and stress levels since adding these gummies to my nightly routine. The 5-HTP in particular seems to have a positive effect on my mental wellbeing.

In terms of the taste and texture, these gummies are really pleasant to take. They have a delicious mixed berry flavor that's not too sweet, and the soft, chewy consistency makes them easy to consume. I also appreciate that they're vegan, non-GMO, and free of any artificial additives.

The only potential downside I've experienced is that the gummies can sometimes make me feel a bit drowsy if I take them too early in the evening. But adjusting the timing to about 30-60 minutes before bedtime has solved that issue.

Overall, these melatonin and 5-HTP gummies have become an essential part of my nightly routine. They help me fall asleep faster, sleep more soundly, and wake up feeling rested and refreshed. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a natural, effective sleep aid.

I use this because I found mold in the apartment. Naturally you have to remove the mold and find the cause of it, meanwhile you did breathe it in so you have it in your body. To remove it from the body I use this Pau D'arco and it helps. It kills it. I am very happy with it.
It helps also with the flue but for that Aronia has the better effect. In addition you can also take it to cleanse your body from toxic metal like amalgan. If you have removed the amalgan in your teeth, you still have it in your body, wit Pau d'arco you can get rid of it.
Because Pau d'arco releases this toxic metals from your body it can be that you feel the first few days even worse, but it means your body is working to get rid of it.
I am very happy with this pau d'arco."

From the moment I started taking them, I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep.

What I love most about these capsules is their gentle yet effective blend of organic herbs like Ashwagandha, Brahmi, and Chamomile, which work synergistically to calm my mind and promote relaxation before bedtime. Unlike other sleep aids I've tried in the past, these capsules don't leave me feeling groggy or lethargic in the morning, allowing me to wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

I also appreciate Organic India's commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing practices. Knowing that the ingredients in these capsules are not only good for me but also support the well-being of the planet and local communities makes me feel good about incorporating them into my daily routine.

Overall, I can't recommend Organic India's Peaceful Sleep capsules enough to anyone struggling with occasional sleeplessness. They've truly been a game-changer for me, and I'm grateful to have found a natural solution that works!"

The fact that it's working while I sleep feels like I'm maximizing my weight loss efforts around the clock.

He told me he’s felling so good and he’s no longer needs to rely on chemicals in the morning but just two dropperful of this extra daily.  Thank you God for giving us all the natural herbs that can heal us from within, and it works very well!  "
5200,"Posted on Mar 28, 2024",Great,"Great quality & ingredients! Good size bottle. Easy dosage instructions. Not too sure how to describe the taste as we mix it into water with elderberry elixir when we are sick. Mullin has many great upper respiratory benefits, as an antioxidant it helps boost your immune system . It’s not going to stop you from coughing, it’s not a cough suppressant it is an expectorant. It helps aid in respiratory health by thinning out mucus making it easier to cough it up. However we have noticed less coughing after taking it, probably due to being able to expel the mucus when we did cough, and it definitely does help to shorten a cold! Highly recommend! "
5200,"Posted on Dec 1, 2023",Amazing stuff for feline asthma,"We’ve been giving this to our cat for about 3 days and it’s already had an effect. We combined it with the NOW respiratory pro biotic so it’s hard to say which is more effective or if one is effective alone.  She went from having a wheezing fit every hour, down to about 5 times a day and now she wheezes about twice a day. That’s good considering the shot the vet was giving her became less effective. We will likely continue with the vet and supplement with this routine.

I just give her three drops in some tuna along with a spec of probiotic. This product will probably last a year at that rate. As a bonus, that’s about 1/20th of what I’ve paid the vet for shots that were no longer working. Win-win. "

What is a '+': it's natural. And this was one of my first points, when choosing this kind of product. 
It's OK to use it in the bathroom, but don't expect it will mask a stink.

Too much zinc or magnesium can cause diarrhea, nausea, and cramping, and when taken in high doses over a period of time, zinc can lower the body's immunity and its levels of HDL, or “good,” cholesterol. From your bones to your blood, the duo calcium-magnesium works synergistically to support various physiological functions, including bone health, muscle function, nerve transmission, and cardiovascular health.

83122,"Posted on Feb 10, 2024",Amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️,"I find it a nice product and it has a lot of benefits but the problem for me that it tastes so sweet. So I replaced it with a lemon balm supplement but i will still use this until I finish it and the quality of the hemp is super high . Several studies show that lemon balm combined with other calming herbs (such as valerian, hops, and chamomile) helps reduce anxiety and promote sleep. Few studies have examined lemon balm by itself, except for topical use. For example, in one study of people with minor sleep problems, 81% of those who took an herbal combination of valerian and lemon balm reported sleeping much better than those who took a placebo. It is not clear from this and other studies whether lemon balm or valerian (or the combination) is responsible for the result.

9846,"Posted on Aug 19, 2024",Kind of a miracle heal,"I never comment, but had to on this one.   Had a long, difficult bout with a contact dermatitus rash combined with cold sore type infection - including recurring subdermal symptoms.  I cleared most of it over several months but there was a lingering node outbreak that resisted all other treatments.  I put one drop of this on it and BAM! it literally killed it on the spot.  I put another drop on 12 hours later and it removed all leftover bits of skin and that was it.  Just gone.  Didn't even use one more drop.   The subdermal element surfaced a couple of days later, another drop on that area and it was gone.  So this was not a wart but I can say thuja has uses far beyond warts and if there is a viral element, it just slays it.   There is some hot sensation where it is active for less than a minute, but feels good because you know it is doing the job.  I feel this would work well on any viral rash, pustule or p o x type problem.  Thank you to the people who produce this to a high standard. "

It took about 3-4 weeks but the wort slowly disappeared and it completely gone now. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from real pain and embarrassment of an ugly wort.

It has resisted every other anti-viral and left me having to take 20grams of Lysine every day. It  had become so strong, even this had stopped being effective. I couldn't tolerate any foods that increased nitric oxide and have been on a very restricted diet to avoid breakouts. The virus had become so virulent, it had taken over much of my body and created severe illness and pain. The moment I got this Thuja, I put it on my lips and all lumps were gone within 2 days. I also placed it in my naval and the severe pain from the virus down my left arm and side completely disappeared overnight. I had tried everything to get that pain down. After 3 applications, I am feeling so much better in my body. I highly recommend this to anyone who has coldsores. "

I don't always need to take the full dose, sometimes you may need to adjust the dose depending on your needs.  Usually if you eat more carbs you might need more vitamin C.  But if your bowels are loose you may need to reduce the vitamin C and adjust on different days.  It can depend on how your body is doing that day and how you're eating and how well you're sleeping etc.  If I take too much vitamin C personally I get runny bowels!

85528,"Posted on Jan 11, 2024",Lithium helps maintain youthful,"Lithium helps maintain youthful, healthy cognition and memory by inhibiting normal, age-related changes in the brain—and can even help protect brain function in healthy individuals.Here’s how:

A healthy brain naturally creates certain types of proteins. These proteins can end up affecting cognition and memory—so your brain has natural, built-in processes for removing them. But this clearing process declines over time as part of normal aging. When that happens, these proteins can begin to accumulate.

A Bodyguard for Your Brain

Preclinical studies indicate that lithium helps support the breakdown of these accumulated brain proteins and promotes the brain’s normal process for clearing cellular debris from your brain cells.

Lithium also helps protect your brain’s neurons (this is called a neuroprotective effect). It does so by inhibiting an enzyme called glycogen synthase kinase-3, or simply GSK3. This enzyme is involved in many different kinds of cellular functions—one of which happens to be the way your brain metabolizes glucose, or blood sugar. So lithium may help maintain already-healthy cerebral glucose metabolism."

Gotu Kola is an herb used traditionally in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, known for its ability to support cognitive functions and circulation health.

The size of the capsules is reasonable, and they're easy to swallow. I included Gotu Kola in my daily regimen to explore its benefits for brain health and potentially improve my circulation, as I've read about its effectiveness in these areas.

Since beginning the capsules, I've noticed a subtle enhancement in my mental clarity and a feeling of increased alertness throughout the day. While it's difficult to measure the improvement in circulation without medical tests, the cognitive benefits have been quite promising.

The packaging is straightforward and no-nonsense. The bottle is well-designed to preserve the freshness of the capsules, with a tight-fitting lid that is easy to open and close. The label is informative, providing clear instructions on dosage and outlining the health benefits of Gotu Kola, which is very helpful for understanding the impact it might have.

Overall, if you're interested in natural supplements to support cognitive and circulatory health, this Gotu Kola supplement could be a great addition. Its ease of use and the noticeable cognitive benefits make it an appealing option for daily supplementation."

One of the most noticeable effects since I started taking this supplement is an improvement in my mental alertness and clarity. Tasks that require concentration seem a bit easier, and I feel more mentally agile throughout the day. This has been particularly beneficial in my professional life, where staying focused and sharp is essential.

I also appreciate the quality of the product. Nature's Answer is a brand I trust for its commitment to purity and natural ingredients. The Gotu Kola extract is potent, and I like that it's in liquid form, which makes it easy to take and allows for quick absorption.

Moreover, I've noticed a subtle but welcome improvement in my overall stress levels. Gotu Kola is known for its adaptogenic properties, and I believe it has helped me manage daily stress more effectively.

In terms of physical benefits, while Gotu Kola is often praised for its skin and circulatory benefits, I primarily chose it for cognitive support, so I can't speak much to these aspects.

In conclusion, Nature's Answer Gotu Kola is a high-quality supplement that I would recommend to anyone looking to support their cognitive function and manage stress naturally. It's easy to take, gentle, and effective"

Although I haven't taken this for long but I would say that this could be a solution if you are in the same negative feedback loop as me: allergy caused by low immune system functionality & limited exercising <-> limited excercising caused by low energy, which is caused by the seasonal energy.

I am also taking allergy relief tablets and vitamin C drinks. These are making me fell better (or it could also be the weather)

But there have been sayings that long dosage of this product can lead to mild fever, so be careful and don't take too much for too long a time.

Whatever it is, this is worth a try ---- At least I am feeling more energetic (idk, It could also be that I just have a grande hot match latte with white chocolate lining)

Stone Breaker helps to ease the pain of passing a kidney stone. It also seemed to help smooth the stones I passed because they weren't as jagged as the earlier ones I passed.

The coconut adds a subtle coconut flavour, so it's great to add to your coffee, hot chocolate, and baking. For baking cakes and muffins, I like to either mix it with half white/cane sugar or I suggest to reduce the brown sugar to make it less sweet and less dark. It adds a nice caramelised flavour or colour to cooking. But you should avoid this if you are making a light colour dish. Its also nice to mix with acid such as lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar to make a salad dressing. Definitely recommend to add to your daily coffee!

I love adding this tincture to mint tea if I feel as though I may be imbalanced, or if I've been eating in a way that would encourage candida overgrowth. It's hard to describe the taste because I'm someone who uses very VERY bitter herbs with ease, so I may not be the best person to describe it's taste. To me, when added to my mint tea it doesn't really change the overall flavour, in my opinion it's a light earthy flavour."

Pros of using a strainer:

2. **Savings**: You can reuse the tea leaves, which saves on buying tea.
3. **Variety**: You can experiment with different types of tea and herbs, which makes the process more fun.

However, there are also cons:

1. **Cleaning**: The strainer needs to be washed regularly to avoid the accumulation of odors and tea residue.
2. **Quality**: Some strainers may not be very durable and may wear out over time.

777,"Posted on Mar 6, 2024",Wonderful product!,"I decided on making my own electrolyte water and have been doing so for the past few years and have not looked back! This is one of the products I put in it in small amounts. To name a few basics, the others include pink salt (or real salt), baking soda, magnesium bisglycinate and taurine. It is very hydrating, smooth and alkaline, and the funny thing is regular water taste so gross to me now 😝! The key is getting the combination of the ingredients just right so that it tastes good and works for you. The taste might be off at first, so some trial and error might be necessary, but you can always look online for more exact recipes. I even looked at several electrolyte products for ideas (and maybe secrets lol). TIP: Whatever amount of pink or real salt you use, the baking soda must be half of that! For example, if you use 1 TSP of salt, use 1/2 TSP of baking soda. I make a big jug that I store in the fridge for convenience, and it lasts me a few days before making a new one. Please 👍 if you found this helpful! 🌼"

777,"Posted on Mar 13, 2024",Easier to use than capsules. ,"Easier to use than capsules. I love the ease of use of this crystal shape. Potassium is required at the cellular level, but the RDA for potassium is 4700 for adults, making it very difficult to obtain from food. Most people have a potassium deficiency, which causes a number of symptoms, including muscle cramps, bloating, water retention, insomnia, and blood pressure problems. I have had calf cramps and severe insomnia for many years and thought I needed to supplement with magnesium. Until I heard that potassium also has many benefits for the nervous system. Happily, I'm already seeing improvement by supplementing with about 1000-2000mg per day on days when I'm sure my diet isn't providing the recommended 4700mg."

777,"Posted on Nov 9, 2023",Mix my own electrolyte beverage,"I have POTS and one of the most important interventions is drinking more and adding more salt to the diet. I tried a homemade ORS solution, but eventually decided against it, because I don’t want to add more sugar to my diet. There are lots of sports drinks on the market that say they rehydrate and top up the electrolyte level, which would be good for POTS, but they are expensive and lots of them contain sugar (sorry, no), calcium (bad for the heart) or artificial sweeteners (some may not be so bad, but I prefer to make my own choice here). 
The people at LMNT seem to have done good research into what a good rehydration electrolyte beverage should contain and they put the recipe on their website, which is awesome. Just look it up, homemade LMNT. One of the ingredients is potassium chloride. I love that it’s a powder, so I can measure it myself and mix it with the other ingredients to make a batch. Each day I prepare two nalgene bottles with my own electrolyte drink and it helps a great deal with my orthostatic intolerance / POTS. Highly recommended.

101704,"Posted on Jul 25, 2024",,"Quercitin is a natural biochemical substance of the flavonoid group. The name comes from the Latin name for oak (Latin Quércus). Quercetin belongs to the group P vitamin preparations. Quercetin may be useful for various types of inflammatory processes, it is able to alleviate the course of allergic reactions - to reduce various manifestations of allergies, incl. lacrimation, runny nose, hives and swelling of the face; possesses quite pronounced immunomodulatory qualities. Additional introduction of quercetin to the diet leads to a significant increase in the activity of killer cells and neutrophils. With the simultaneous administration of quercetin with vitamin C, the immunomodulatory effect increases several times, which significantly increases the body's resistance to infections. It is also useful for the cardiovascular system.Please consider giving a thumbs up to my review.thank you.

The medical literature research shows Quercetin is also helpful in part protecting as a prophylactic against covid spike protein attaching to ACE2 receptors.
But then if you get covid it’s only helpful for first few days, after that the body needs to upregulate ACE2 to get rid of the spike protein and quercetin doesn’t help as it downregulates ACE2.
This is only based on the literature I’ve read so please don’t take this as fact, and as all research can change with new information. "

The flavors are on point, as usual. The defining quality that made them worth their price is the health benefits. Just two lollipops contain 150% of the daily recommended intake of Vitamin-C. That's what makes them so special.

Regarding the flavor variations, it's pretty evenly distributed. I found no issue finding a particular flavor, I am appreciative of that.

The only aspect of the product that needs improvement is the packaging. It's just a plastic bag with their logo. It isn't visually appealing and the bag itself is quite weak. Unfortunately some of the lollipops were found without a wrapper, and few were found crushed in their wrapper. I'm not sure if it was a manufacture issue or a shipping & handling issue. Perhaps that is worth looking into.

Worth it for the convienence. Taking your Vitamin-C while tasting amazing."

I like that it comes in a cardboard box & individually packaged tea bags. I use this as a relaxing drink since it is caffeine-free.

It is always fresh and it has much better depth of flavor than the leaf and root combination. I purchase this tea on a regular basis. I really appreciate that Traditional Medicinals uses a good amount of herbs in their teabags and is not skimpy. One bag is enough to make a large 14-16 oz mug of tea (unlike many other companies that hav weak herbs and are skimpy with the amount in their teabags. I am very willing to pay more for a  high quality full teabag. I make a morning tea with this and a milk thistle tea bag to help keep my liver healthy. I read you should only take dandelion for 2 weeks at a time, then take a break from it, so I make sure to pulse it and not take it everyday. "

Tea tree oil is known for its powerful antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, making it a popular natural ingredient in many personal care and wellness products. The Aura Cacia formula provides a high-quality, USDA certified organic source of this versatile essential oil.

I've heard a lot of positive feedback about using tea tree oil for supporting skin health, fighting occasional blemishes, and even helping with respiratory issues when used aromatically. The active compounds in tea tree oil, like terpinen-4-ol, are what give it those beneficial properties.

What I like about the Aura Cacia brand is their commitment to using pure, sustainable, and ethically sourced ingredients without any synthetic additives. Their tea tree oil is steam-distilled to ensure maximum potency and purity.

Overall, the Aura Cacia Organic Tea Tree Essential Oil seems like an excellent natural option if you're looking to harness the power of this versatile essential oil. It could be a great addition to your natural wellness routine, whether you use it topically, aromatically"

I am using it in a holistic health plan regime guided by a doctor. The size is 2 fl oz, which is a decent amount. My dosage 2 dropper full, once daily with activated charcoal 30 minutes after.  The ingredients are great and seems to be of good quality.

- 8/10 days of long mucoid plaques and gunk build up from my intestines (wasn't fecal matter either)
- dead short parasite worms every days from the colonic (2-3L of warm water)

Drank directly from the dropper and it was bitter. Need to gulp more water to dilute it. 
Try mix in inside water and then gulp down. Then drank more water to dilute. This is a better option. 
The bitter taste is not much different from
Cough syrup. It is not that bad actually. Medicine generally are bitter. The alcohol in it gave it a burning taste. Overall acceptable since this is for health.

Start slow with the dosage and work the way up. One to two hr after the dosage, eat the charcoal pill to bind the toxin. Poo is smelly but I guess it is part of detox. Need to drink a lot of water in the day to flush the body. Otherwise I will have some headache effect.

All those trails I have been having since especially I was a teen   were gone. 

It is much more easier to set healthy boundary with people and negative energy around me(this is great for empaths). My happiness has been increasing and unknown irritation and anger decreased a ton as well.

I've also been taking oregano oil and the taste/smell is very similar, with the oregano oil being the stronger of the two. I started with 1/2 tsp twice a day, but will increase this to 1 tsp, twice a day. I currently have a cough (it arrived the same day this oil did!), am experiencing perimenopause, fatige, and joint/body pain, muscle fatigue. I plan to take this for a solid month and I will update if I feel this black seed oil has had any effect on my current state. I actually kind of like the taste.

I notice it has changed my appetite even more (in taking this in addition to berberine and nascent iodine ) ... ive lost weight and will continue to monitor my progress.

Couldn't go more than 4-5 hours without taking a sugar boost , cant lie made me feel more energetic. And than the problem with the sugar came up and i had to cut sugar completely.

But so far I can say that , I dont know if its a mental thing , but since i started tsking this product i go all day without sugar no problem . This product has gaven me lots of power and stamina.

10816,"Posted on May 4, 2024",Really powerful ,This oil is really potent and only half a teaspoon taken daily made a positive impact on my health within a short period of time. I suffer from poor blood circulation in my legs and often end up with swollen legs at the end of a long day. Taking black cumin seed oil really reduced the usual swelling. I also noticed my skin that tends to be on the dryer side is more supple and plumped. I will update this review after 2-3 months of consistent use.
10816,"Posted on May 3, 2024",So far so good...,"Despite some of the reviews that said this has a terrible smelland didn't trust the product...to me, the smell and taste weren't. completely terrible. I've also been taking oregano oil and the taste/smell is very similar, with the oregano oil being the stronger of the two. I started with 1/2 tsp twice a day, but will increase this to 1 tsp, twice a day. I currently have a cough (it arrived the same day this oil did!), am experiencing perimenopause, fatige, and joint/body pain, muscle fatigue. I plan to take this for a solid month and I will update if I feel this black seed oil has had any effect on my current state. I actually kind of like the taste. I've taken it both with and without food, and have not noticed any negative effects. "

And it goes down so easy,  i use a forget to mix it well into the water/citrus supplement mix.  I notice it has changed my appetite even more (in taking this in addition to berberine and nascent iodine ) ... ive lost weight and will continue to monitor my progress. Im hypothyroid and I've never seen weight loss until now so I'm excited to see where this takes me with the test of my vitamins!

The larger size 25 is what I like although I have also purchased the 16.9 oz one as well. I love EVOO but it can get very expensive so by using this in between I cut down on olive oil use and cost.

My stool tests were negative for bacteria and inflammation so I got this out of desperation to see if it would help. It got rid of my diarrhea the next day. I will continue to take 2 pills daily forever!! It is that good. Must be taken on an empty stomach to avoid cumin burps. If you take it after eating, the oil kind of sits on top of your food digesting and you will have spicy burps for 3 hours. I take it when I wake up and then once before dinner. It is supposed to help fight cancer and I am at high risk for colon cancer, so I will keep taking this."

 The unique manufacturing process of Ester-Cs neutralizes the pH, making it non-acidic and gentle on the stomach.

 A daily dose of 1000 mg of Ester-C will provide you with active support of your immune system and powerful antioxidant activity.



 Clinical studies show that Ester C can increase levels of vitamin C in white blood cells, an essential part of the immune system.  The result?  Ester-C stays in your immune system up to 2x longer than regular vitamin C.

GABA is a naturally occurring amino acid in the brain that helps reduce neural excitability, and for me, it’s really helped to take the edge off when I’m feeling stressed.

The capsules I bought are 750 mg, which is a pretty substantial size, but honestly, they haven’t bothered me at all. I take them throughout the day, and what I love most is that they calm me down without making me feel drowsy or groggy. I can stay alert and focused, which is so important when I need to keep going with my day.

What’s great about GABA is that it feels like a natural way to manage anxiety. It supports the brain’s own calming processes, so I’m not relying on anything too intense. If you’re looking for something that helps with stress but doesn’t mess with your energy or focus, I’d definitely recommend giving GABA a try!"

The higher dosage per capsule means I don't have to take as many, which is convenient. Just a note of caution, start with a lower dose to see how your body reacts before increasing to the full dose."

It’s been about a week since he has been on it and so far it’s been a miracle for him."

If I need to take fat-soluble vitamins and there's no suitable food, a tablespoon of coconut butter helps me out. I keep it in the kitchen cupboard. The butter doesn't change its color, smell and consistency.  The manufacturer indicated on the package that refrigeration isn't necessary.  I chose this particular butter because it's made from raw organic coconut, it's whole coconut puree. This butter can be consumed raw, added to porridge, soups or smoothies, spread over, baked with it. Suitable for Keto diet and vegetarians. Safe packaging. Container: glass, lid: thin metal.

MY EXPERIENCE: Just 1-2 drops to a mop tub makes an excellent floor cleaner with nice scent.  By applying a few drops to my temples brings instant relief for my headaches or nausea when travelling.  I exchange the press-down cap with a twist & turn one from previous bottle as it is convenient to open & sprinkle on my finger-tips without having to find a flat surface to press down the cap (see pic).

So, it is with much gratitude that I found an effective supplement... one I can take cyclically. That does not worsen my symptoms OR exacerbate die-off response.

The size is generous but makes it weighty to carry around. I have transferred some to a smaller bottle. The sticky feeling vanishes once it's fully rubbed dry. The spray nozzle doesn't work as smoothly as I'd like - sometimes when I press down even when it's upright, there is no spray. Overall, I like it. "
97263,"Posted on Jan 1, 2024",Love this!! ,I love this. It smells amazing. The lemongrass smell is just perfect and not too overpowering.  It's alcohol-free so good for babies and kids. It is affordable and good for sensitive skin. One spray is enough. The size is good to fit into my handbag. I always have one in my car and in my bag. I have bought many bottles especially during covid. Highly recommend it.

However I was actually trying to get it to serve as  my hand sanitiser and maybe the room sanitising spray at the same time. I am not sure if the alcohol-free formula makes it a good room sanitiser, but I am happy with this product :)
Easy cleaning of hand, just spray and massage dry, no greasy feel nor drying feelings.

Great supplement for overall cognitive performance especially with focus, memory recall and clear thinking. This is a must in any supplement stack!"
12803,"Posted on Mar 15, 2024",Cognitive reinforcement,"I take alpha gpc cause it helps me with the cognitive function and the difference is big. when I'm taking this product, I can focus better and I can think a little bit better and that makes all the difference you need. 300mg per one capsule so I take two. if I want more dosage I can take up to 4 and that seems like adding up all the benefits. would recommend taking this before any work that requires cognitive function. it will help you through. "
12803,"Posted on Nov 8, 2023",AWESOME,"I recently tried and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. I'd give it a solid 5-star rating. The pros are numerous – it boosted my cognitive function, improved my focus, and gave me a great energy kick. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the price is a bit on the higher side, but the results are worth it. In a nutshell, it met and exceeded my expectations. The taste and smell are neutral since it's in capsule form. It's a valuable product for the price, and I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their mental performance. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed!"
12803,"Posted on Nov 3, 2023",,"Got this to help with my ADHD issues. I actually went through most of the bottle without feeling much of anything different and was very disappointed with it at first so I stopped taking it for a while. It wasn't until I started supplementing with a B-Complex and vitamin D3 recently then added this back into my supplement routine that it finally did something. Shortly after taking this, esp. around half an hr later? my mind feels noticeably clearer and sharper and it becomes much easier to focus and think. So this does work me after all, as long as it's taken with those vitamins."

Just one in the morning makes a big difference to how sharp I'm am mentally through the day - even with anaemia brain-fog I can still dig for a second and find those words and concepts I knew were in there somewhere. Sadly the Now Foods Alpha GPC has been getting very expensive lately and is often out of stock, so I've been using other brands like Swanson and EVLution and have been impressed with the quality of those others too.
