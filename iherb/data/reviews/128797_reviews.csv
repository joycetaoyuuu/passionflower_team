1,128797,2024-04-14,Works well,"Helps me to shut off and relax before I sleep, not as good without melatonin but still works to calm down I feel. "
2,128797,2023-11-14,Completely ineffective!,"Feels no difference with and without. Tried for a week, still no





 effect. Simply a bottle of gummy bear."
3,128797,2024-02-27,It works~,"It's not as effective as melatonin, but it still helps me fall asleep. Instead, I think I should take a larger dose than melatonin."

5,128797,2024-03-05,Excellent!,"I previously took a product that contained 3mg of melatonin, but it is not available in Korea. I'll try the melatonin-free product too. I hope it works :)"
6,128797,2024-02-04,It's nice to be able to sleep,"It's more effective than the product I'm used to. The quality and ingredients are natural, so I'm relieved because it's non-habit forming. It's small in size, tastes good, and the dosage is 2 pills, so it's okay."
7,128797,2023-12-07,Sleep peacefully,"First of all, it's easy to eat. It's sweet so I don't think it would bother me if I brush my teeth, but it's sugar free. I just eat it. The size is good and the effect is small. The dosage is just right."
8,128797,2024-06-06,amazing,"It deserves more than five stars. It helped me sleep, but unfortunately it is always closed "

14,128797,2023-11-23,sleep disorder,I tried it for sleep. I'll start taking it now and see more effects.
15,128797,2024-07-09,,"Why did you try to calm me down, but I don't sleep, but my son doesn't sleep, nor do I unless you're tired. It helps you sleep, but it doesn't let you sleep if you stay up late and want to adjust your sleep.
"
16,128797,2024-06-17,not too bad,It is difficult to expect any special effects.
