6,56089,2024-10-05,Moderate help,"If you have moderate anxiety, this may help. It's not designed for severe anxiety. The kava makes you feel a little weird but it's not a bad feeling. "
7,56089,2022-12-25,,"‚ô•Ô∏èIt's my favourite product on iHerb! Really, I feel the difference within few minutes. For quick effect hold it for up to 30 sec in the mouth. I feel a rapid relaxation! It works for me, any other mixture doesn't work so effectively for me‚ô•Ô∏è The raste is strong, bitter lavender. For me it's ok"
8,56089,2024-05-04,Tastes awful,This tastes absolutely awful. Not sure if it works on anxiety because I spend the next 45 minutes trying to get the taste out of my mouth. It does seem like it would benefit me but I can't get over the strong lavender taste. 
9,56089,2024-03-24,Love in seltzer but‚Ä¶,"The taste is very intense. I was hoping to use this as a lavender flavored bitters for soda water but I could only handle a couple of drops. It tastes good like that, but it‚Äôs not enough to achieve the calming effect. "
10,56089,2023-02-13,,"This  lavender tincture has excellent ingredients controlling anxiety, it works within minutes,  I‚Äôve been using it in my older age. The quality is always consistent.  It has a mild lavender taste, good supplement to keep at hand.  I like the fast acting reliefs and the affordable price.  I have not concerns about long time use."

22,56089,2023-08-14,,"I have anxieties quite often and it is not easy to find something that helps, has no side effects and is not made out of unpronounceable ingredients. This product is herbal and it surprisingly works well for me. Every time I have a feeling like I am getting an anxious spell I take it and some time after I feel its calming effect. I will buy again. "

25,56089,2024-07-26,Liver sensitivity ,"Be careful when buying this, because it can generate pain in your liver area. Probably I will not buy it again."
26,56089,2023-12-02,Lovely tincture,"Very potent, a bit laxative. A prefer the passionflower form the same brand. "
27,56089,2023-10-02,Does what it should.,"I needed this during a very anxious time in my life, and it has helped me a lot.

Mind you, it made me drowsy and sleepy, but it did calm me down. I'm very thankful I found such a healthy and natural way to soothe anxiety."
28,56089,2023-09-19,Works great and tastes not bad,it always helps me sleep better and control my anxiety level. for some reason the non alcohol version doesn't seem to do the same trick for me as this one does. will be buying again!
29,56089,2023-08-31,,"helps me quiet down at night, a must have for me. I especially like that I only need a small amount, a few drops in water does the trick. I don't really taste the alcohol much at all and it really helps calm my anxiety at night."
30,56089,2023-07-31,,"Well, anything with lavender content gives a soothing feeling, so this is no different. It is quite strong and potent tho, so might be better to have the drops with some water. I usually drop the
 straight into the mouth, as I like the smell of it "
31,56089,2023-06-27,Amazing Instant Relaxation,This product does exactly what it says it does - it provides instant relaxation!  Just the thing to calm you down when anxiety or nervousness hits you. 
32,56089,2023-06-13,,"Absolutely in love! I was looking or a high quality product and not pills at the same time. I absolutely love this one. The taste is very strong and not the best, but works really well with a juice. Will be ordering again! "
33,56089,2024-10-14,Strong smell,"It smells and tastes like a lavander perfum. I tried few times it didn't make me calm, it didn't help with anxiety, sadly."
34,56089,2024-01-30,very bitter to the taste in small doses ,"It does not improve or remove my anxiety.  It is very bitter to the taste in small doses.  I have to use lightly sweetened drinks to mix it in to dilute the taste.  But overall, it does not improve my mood.  "
35,56089,2023-07-25,,"I didn‚Äôt notice a major difference with anxiety symptoms or sleep. This supplement will still benefits many others I‚Äôm sure. The lavender flavour was very potent and difficult to mask.  The measuring dropper was precise and easy to use. The ingredients were a great mix to try, just unfortunate they didn‚Äôt help me."
36,56089,2022-08-22,,"I like to use  few drops of this before bed to help with falling asleep from time to time and I think it does help.  There is a strong taste of lavender, so it won't be for everyone, but I don't mind it at all.  It's  bit expensive, so I don't use it daily. Overall, I really like Herb Pharm's products in general."
37,56089,2022-08-01,,"I love the quality and composition of this tincture, the ingredients tastes good and not like hemp will. I am concerned when it comes to kava or calming supplements being too much but this is perfect any time of day and doesn't last long if you are worried about it interrupting your focus. There is noticeable improvement and benefits for anxiety and sleep. calming mental benefits for any time of day and does not age easily. It works well with my diet. The bottle was packaged well and there is a noticeable improvement in my mood. I recommend a snack or water (I just squeeze it on my tongue). I take multiple medications and supplements and it doesn't conflict with any too."
38,56089,2024-02-15,,Maybe a bit too strong and I don‚Äôt seem to sleep well on it 
39,56089,2021-11-04,Helpful,"Gosh. This has helped with my anxiety.  I use it when I notice my triggers and it helps to calm me. I thought the basil flavor would be strange, but I like it a lot in my hot tea. "
40,56089,2023-02-15,,"This did not seem to work for me as well as another product. Taste was unpleasant, but not unbearable. I will not be reordering this. "
41,56089,2022-04-03,Great product,"I bought this for my daughter who suffers terribly with anxiety and didn't want her to be medicated, this is a great option and love that its in liquid form."
42,56089,2022-02-08,,"Actually this ""kills"" the anxiety. 

Great to have in the purse and take when you need it;  it works pretty fast if taken without food. 

The taste is so so.. and quite harsh on the tung, so drop it in a little glass of juice or in coffee. 

"
43,56089,2023-08-22,Amazing!,Exelent! Was very calming! Gonna bye it again!! üôÇüôÇ very gooooood
44,56089,2023-07-12,,"it works for me and 15 years old boy , half a dropper or less  is enough  when taking full dropper makes us vomitting"
45,56089,2023-06-27,,Great quality brand with pure ingredients. Felt the benefit of lavender in 1 dose.
46,56089,2023-05-19,,this helped my anxiety a lot. And has good quality ingredients. would recommend
47,56089,2023-04-24,,This product brings a sense of ease and helps soothe my mind and body. 
48,56089,2023-03-13,,great product really makes me feel better and achieves what it sets out to achieve! I recommend 
49,56089,2023-02-27,,"Clean ingredients, great for stress! The glass bottle is far superior to any other packaging. "
50,56089,2023-02-08,,I don't like the alcohol and taste but it works very well!!
51,56089,2023-02-07,,"Excellent product, I am more than satisfied with quality and price."
52,56089,2022-11-02,,"Excellent, I am very happy with quality and price and I will buy again "
53,56089,2023-10-07,,Good for calming for anxiety. But the taste is bitter. 
54,56089,2022-01-17,Tastes like lavender,I think it helps. It tastes like drinking lavender oil- not for me. I'd rather use lavender oil than this stuff though. I'm sure it's good quality and good ingredients but the taste isn't worth it (I added it to juice). Rub lavender oil on topically instead.
55,56089,2021-01-24,,"I recently discovered I get anxiety so dealing with it is still new to me. I add this to my water bottle on days I know I am getting anxious about and it calms me making the day manageable. 
The taste is a bit strong but I only add half the amount recommended and it still works for me, in addition doesn't taste as strong."
56,56089,2020-05-19,Staple,"I have been using this product for several years very satisfactorily, and was concerned with social distance in the small  shop from which I had purchased;  In addition, I am in LOCKDOWN, and incapable of shopping.  With the new rules, I must change my buying habits, and chose to order on line. "
57,56089,2022-08-26,,"I definitely liked the quality ingredients and benefits this supplement offered. I saw improvement in my anxiety.  I will admit the taste was an adjustment but t g e pros definitely outweigh the cons.
"
58,56089,2021-04-29,Helps with anxiety and sleep,Am autistic and have anxiety issues. A drop seems to reduce some anxiety. 2 drops may cause drowsiness after about 2 hrs. Helps me fall asleep but I do wake up in between sometimes. I add it to hot tea with a little sugar so that it won't taste too bad.
59,56089,2023-01-29,,It's not too bad. Thought it would be a little stronger.
60,56089,2022-01-30,,"This has been a very disappointing experience for me. Not only does the drink taste like dollar whiskey, but it also does not help relieve my anxiety. In my experience, the tincture does not have any noticeable effects, and I regret making the purchase. It seems that the quality is lacking, since I am unable to sense any effects whatsoever. I was drawn to this product by the ingredients listed, but I did not experience any effects."
61,56089,2021-07-31,,This definitely made me feel more relaxed but the taste was a shocker.  If you can get over the taste then it's a great product.  
62,56089,2021-05-30,Excellent! Though the taste takes a little getting used to.,"I bought this because of the mix of lavender oil and kava kava. I tried it this afternoon after a hard morning that resulted in a stress headache. I took care of the headache at lunch and at about 2, still feeling a little anxious from the stress of the morning, I decided to give this a try. One squeezer full into 2 oz of water is recommended. If you like the smell of lavender oil you may like this. The smell is of full on distilled lavender oil. The smell in water is beautiful (to me), and breathing that alone may help some people in the way aromatherapy can. Seriously, the smell is strong and it looks a little funny in water, and before drinking it you will come read reviews again on iHerb before you decide that yes, you really are supposed to drink this. That's what I did. Best drunk quickly. I did and here's what I noticed. I've been a kava drinker for more than twenty years. About 10 minutes after drinking this product, I noticed the familiar slight numbing on the roof of my mouth that is characteristic of kava kava. That's a good sign for me, as kava has always been my go to anxiety reducer. After about 45 minutes, I was feeling mildly relaxed and things that were bothering me earlier suddenly weren't. So, do I think it works? Yes, for me, it does. It's not the full on effect of drinking bowls of kava five minutes apart (if you are ever invited in the Polynesian triangle), but it's a good effect nonetheless. Probably good before bed or long meditation. And while it is hard to drink, I do love the smell, and drinking it will get better over time. I will be buying Herb Pharm Anxiety Soother again. Nicely blended Herb Pharm!"
63,56089,2021-05-13,,I had my doubts about this product but it works like a dream! I am dealing with a mom in late stages Alzheimer's and desperately needed some relief from the stress and anxiety that wasn't pharmaceutical. These drops were the answer to a prayer!
64,56089,2020-03-16,Feel best product in the market ! ,"very fast & comfortable shipping.
In my opinion, this product is the best in the market today. 
It takes away all the pressure and the bad thoughts I am sometimes having. 
"
65,56089,2019-10-22,works well,"It worked well for my fear of flying when went to Fiji.
I put 24 drops in a bottle of water and sipped through the morning before getting on the plane.
Taste is strong though."
66,56089,2022-09-21,,decided to try this oil for anxiety and it REALLY helps
67,56089,2022-05-06,,Helps me so much sleeping! Soothes my anxiety and puts me right to sleep. Love this product and will be purchasing again! 
68,56089,2021-11-08,,Am using 3-5 drops into half glass of water.  Tastes terribly but it works so I just gulp it down. I recommend it
69,56089,2017-08-17,It works but the taste is terrible,My doc recommended this product to help me stop using Lorazepam for sleep. It worked but I was only on .25mg for about 2 months so not sure it would work for people with existing dependency. It made me groggy after about 30 minutes of ingestion but of course it didn't knock me out like prescription strengths meds would. I wouldn't expect that from herbal supplement anyhow. 3 stars for me overall. Deducted one star for a terrible taste.
70,56089,2020-05-05,Seems to work,This has a very strong flavor which I have acquired a taste for and actually really like now (reminds me a bit of Gin). Seems to really help. I think the strong flavor may help by giving a bit of an instant placebo effect. 
71,56089,2022-09-24,,"Quality is good, my age 31 and have an anxiety issues, this product helped me. Good package. Improve my sleep"
72,56089,2021-12-18,,"Amazing to chill out at the end of the day, strong taste good in a juice "
73,56089,2021-03-09,,"This product is absolutely fabulous!! 
I‚Äôm glad I ordered it! I recommend it ! "
74,56089,2021-02-16,,Great product. Very calming. One dropperful usually does the trick for me.
75,56089,2020-12-12,The lavender oil was unbearable,"Unfortunately I could not stomach this product. I tried it twice and couldn¬¥t do it anymore, because the predominant flavor (and smell) of lavender made it unusable for me. It literally felt like I was drinking cologne, lavender cologne. And the taste would linger. I was very excited about the blend of the other herbs, expecting this to soothe me in the evening before sleep but it wasn¬¥t to be. Now everyone¬¥s different, I¬¥m sure other people don¬¥t mind the lavender and can enjoy this product. Not me, so I had to give it  the 1 star for that reason."
76,56089,2020-09-11,,The one and only product that has helped me with my anxiety 
77,56089,2017-03-22,Works,I have found this one rly effective even when I'm extremely anxious. tastes absolutely foul tho hehe
78,56089,2021-08-21,,"Hands down, my go to formula for smoothing out the spikes & rough edges."
79,56089,2021-02-13,,"Has a really great calming effect, but horrible taste. Difficult to drink..  "
80,56089,2020-12-11,,"love this brand, they always use the best herbs. a great calmant"
81,56089,2018-08-12,Use for aromatherapy not as a tea. ,"Take this internally at your own risk.  It has essential oil of lavender in it.  Essential oils are not to be taken internally.
The description says  ""Anxiety Soother is non-sedating, pleasant tasting, and non-habit forming.""
As with other extracts I have from Herb-Pharm, I put a few drops on my tongue, it was not the alcohol that assaulted my senses but the essential oil.  I spat it out and rinsed my mouth over and over and that oil clings hard in the oral cavity. I use it as aromatherapy and find instant relief, it's a pleasant and soothing product for aromatherapy. "
82,56089,2019-01-19,Yuck,"My apologies to the manufacturer, but this is disgusting. It tastes like drinking perfume. I haven't tried it more than two times. I am not sure how well it works since I am unable to continue using it."
83,56089,2022-03-07,,Excellent 
84,56089,2022-03-02,,like it
85,56089,2022-07-10,,The lavender taste is  over powering. Would not recommend. 
86,56089,2021-09-16,,The taste is so hard to get past that I honestly don't use it.  I didn't realize it had lavender... it's just way to strong and hard to get past the taste to want to use.  
87,56089,2021-02-09,,"Might be hit or miss for people with liver issues. Kava slows down Phase 1 liver detox pathways. I found all my other supplements stopped working while I was taking this, and my liver pathways ground to a halt. "
88,56089,2021-01-11,,I gave it 2 stars because I don't notice any difference or feel a thing at all even at three times the recommended dose.  I wouldn't buy again. 
89,56089,2019-06-30,It Works,Relaxation is the best feeling to get. 
90,56089,2021-01-09,,"Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the other reviews here. The taste is terrible, almost undrinkable. This gave me an instant headache and did the opposite of reducing stress. I tried a few times in a vaporiser to see if that worked but it made me feel very strange and did not have a relaxing effect at all. "
91,56089,2020-09-09,Terrible taste,"This for me was the worst herbal I have ever tasted,  it was like perfume,  I really wondered if it had been mistakenly filled with something else but as I can see on the reviews looks like that's how it's meant to be, so bad I dont think I will be continuing with this product !"
92,56089,2021-08-22,,This does what it says. Quickly calms my anxiety. 
93,56089,2021-07-01,,Strong numbing taste. Chill feeling 
94,56089,2021-03-24,,Haven‚Äôt used it yet
95,56089,2020-10-27,,Works well. Great for sleep!
96,56089,2021-02-17,,Seems to work pretty good
97,56089,2022-06-22,,Strong bad smell don‚Äôt recommend it
98,56089,2021-07-30,,Excellent!
99,56089,2021-02-08,,Taste bitter but effective
100,56089,2021-01-25,–ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ!,Good!
101,56089,2020-10-06,Not Good,"The taste is unbearable doesn't work, waste of
 money. "
102,56089,2018-07-05,I Dont Know,I bought it and tried it once. The taste was terrible...and i dont know if i could use it in a future :(
103,56089,2021-01-25,,Didnt really feel any effect
104,56089,2021-02-01,,"Taste is really really bad, like you would drink lavender essential oil. Also 0 effects "

106,56089,2024-06-25,Top product for everyone ,"Easy to use, I recommend this product to everyone, the quality of this product is one of the best on the market, the packaging is reliable and there were no questions about it, the composition does not differ from competitive products, the size is convenient for use here is large + "
107,56089,2024-03-23,Fast-acting tranquilizer,"I use it when I feel anxious due to PMS. Just place 3 drops on the back of your tongue and you'll feel calm within 5 minutes. The first time I used it, I accidentally put it on my tongue and the strong bitter taste made me nauseous. Even if you put it under your tongue, you will feel some bitterness, so if you don't like bitter tastes, it may be better to put it in water and drink it."
108,56089,2024-01-24,,"I bought it to combat stress, I was looking for an analogue of the drug Lazeya. I did not notice a special effect, because one jar was not enough for a long time. Maybe you need a long-term reception. The taste is pleasant "
109,56089,2024-10-12,excellent,"Nice smell, convenient packaging, good size, clear advantages, good quality"
110,56089,2024-02-19,"Excellent, recommend","Nice smell, convenient and big packaging, obvious benefits. good quality! Recommend.. I bought a second time"

115,56089,2014-11-30,"will be quiet, like a mammoth","When compared to conventional means (valerian, putyrnikom or other means with Herbie - swedish tranquility, calm aid), then this thing is an order of magnitude stronger. Go to the left lane you do not want, they are all there taaaak chase :) After 40 drops of both positive and negative emotions disappear completely for about three hours or four, angry or upset will not work well in any way. And if at a lower dose, personally I did not take it. I even have the impression that what is usually chronically ill, sick ceases. But always take these drops, I would not, I want all the world to perceive colors. However, it is a bubble, I buy on the safe side."
116,56089,2024-06-14,,Small size smelly taste disgusting. I didn't like Lavender Body Cream Grapes at all.
117,56089,2015-11-04,Full relax,"I liked the taste of lavender and vile, but you quickly get used to it. One of the best herbal sedatives that met in life. At the same time you are emotionally empty, but there is no drowsiness, no apathy, no recoil. You leave softly. Acts strongly in the first hours of -6- 8, and the residual effect is not less than a day. @@@ At exams, mortgages, harmful colleagues and fear of flights - did not fail me once."
118,56089,2021-01-23,,"It is a pity that the product was taken out of production, soothed quickly and effectively. Saw when stressed at work. Emotions just left and everything was getting better"

120,56089,2022-02-21,a feeling of peace of mind,"It is bitter, but the taste is reassuring. This is a comfortable product to try"
121,56089,2021-01-26,,"I bought it according to reviews, as a strong sedative, but it had almost no effect on me. Average good, but I need something different."
