22,68758,2021-05-28,Life changing,"My husband and I both tried this at the start of our most recent lockdown in Victoria, Australia.  We wanted to make sure that we're in good health during these punitive external stressors, and lack of sleep is really debilitating to physical, emotional, and mental health.

We took as directed, just over half an hour before bed.  We both slept very deeply and woke up refreshed.  The only problem was that we woke up two hours later than we ordinarily would!   Tonight we will try it earlier in the night (perhaps two hours before we intend to go to bed).  "
23,68758,2020-08-06,Very pleased by this natural sleeping pill,"I have severe insomnia almost every night. These pills helped me a lot - one pill makes me sleep long enough and I wake up feeling good and anxiety-free. The liquid softgels are high quality, and have not been leaking during transport during this hot summer (while other liquid pills have). I think the liquid delivery is a lot better than delivery using powder capsules."
24,68758,2020-02-25,Sweet Dreams,These 'Power to Sleep' capsules have been amazing for me. I take them each night and I find they do help me get to sleep. I really like that they're naturally based and still work really well.  Yes there has been the odd occasion when nothing I try works but that's the exception not the rule. I'm very happy with them and make sure not to run out!
25,68758,2021-11-26,,It doesn't really work for me. The dosage says 2 tablets. But it doesn't really work as what I expected. Perhaps the composition doesn't suit me. 
26,68758,2021-01-03,,"Irwin Naturals Power to Sleep works great for me.  The 6 mg of melatonin knocks me out fairly quickly.  There are many brands out there that do nothing for me, but this one is a keeper. "

Can cause colorful dreams by the way,  really like a movie but happening in your real life, so  if you should be aware of it :) "
29,68758,2018-06-20,Love love love Power to Sleep,I love this product it works great. I sleep well most night and still wake up a couple of times a night but fall back to sleep. When it is time to get up I can wake and feel refreshed.

40,68758,2020-01-14,Don’t understand,"Sometimes they work in the matter of 30 min, sometimes it takes 4 hours (same dose). Also, I don’t believe for a second That they have either 3 or 6 mg melatonin at all, as they are weaker than my 2mg circadin. I need at least 2 of these to get tired, mostly I take 3. Circadin I take 1 or 2. "
