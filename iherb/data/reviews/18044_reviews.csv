0,18044,2024-03-29,great product,"I recently tried Passion Flower by NOW Foods, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my quest for natural stress relief and relaxation. Here's my detailed review based on my experience:

Effectiveness:
Passion Flower is renowned for its calming properties and its ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. I found this to be true in my own experience. Incorporating Passion Flower into my daily routine helped me manage stress more effectively, leading to a noticeable reduction in feelings of anxiety and tension. I particularly appreciated that it didn't leave me feeling sluggish or foggy-headed, allowing me to remain alert and focused throughout the day."

It has benefitted me to go back to sleep quicker when I wake up in the night & its improved my quality of a better night of sleep. I have no concern for being ""groggy"" from using this supplement."

4,18044,2024-01-05,,"I've been taking Passion Flower capsules for a few years, primarily to help with my stress and anxiety. The benefits have been pleasantly surprising. I find myself feeling calmer and more relaxed, especially in situations that would normally make me anxious. Great improvement thanks to a natural quality product!

5,18044,2024-01-05,Relax,"I really loved these! Passion flower has always made me relax significantly, and I wanted something in pill form after using a tincture for awhile. These were really effective in my opinion. I slept better, I didn't have as many racing thoughts, and was generally at ease. The ingredients are great too, it's an all vegan formula. There wasn't any taste at all and I thought the quality was top notch (as it usually is with NOW brand). I will definitely keep buying these! "

Strongly recommend !!!"
9,18044,2024-07-01,Calming and sleep-promoting,"I was on neuro-mag for sleep and was afraid it might affect Calcium absorption as my Magnesium levels are adequate. Then I opted for passion flower from now and it provided a good results for sleep and mood. I find the package size very good when compared to the price and it provides quality results with a sole ingredient of passion flower. A dosage of 350 mg is not too high and not too low too for a soul daily dose. Has no taste but has a mild, but acceptable odor. the benefit is good and recommended for an adequate and limited time use,"
10,18044,2024-09-24,Mild relaxation,"Good product, although I didn't used it much yet, but does make you feel more relaxed, but not as much as other products, for example ""Kava Kava"". but what great it has high safety profile."

15,18044,2024-07-20,Did not feel the benefit,Tried this for 3 months and did not actually feel any benefits out of it. Not sure if it's because 3 months is too short to feel the effect of the product quality. Now foods are always known for their authentic ingredients.

25,18044,2023-12-09,Good product,This is a good choice for people that want to take Passion flower as a supplement in capsule form. The only downside is that it contains silicon dioxide at can create digestive problems for some people.

29,18044,2023-04-27,Calm and Focused: My Experience with NOW Foods Passion Flower Capsules,"I've found that taking NOW Foods Passion Flower has helped me in unexpected ways. As someone who leads a busy and sometimes stressful life, I've noticed that taking this supplement has helped me to feel more relaxed and centered. I've also noticed an improvement in my sleep quality - I fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of this supplement and the benefits it provides."
30,18044,2023-03-25,,"OH MY GOD THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! If you are concerned or deal with any form of anxiety then look no further.. i was shocked by this product, i took the recommended amount of supplements written in the back of the packaging and it started working around 30min after. Composition of ingredients are great, high quality, tastes like nothing"
31,18044,2024-04-08,I am yet  to be convinced,"I have tried to incorporate this into my sleep routine, but I notice no real effect, whether taken alone or with other things. It does not help to get me to sleep, or get me back to sleep, but it is sold for mood effects, rather than sleep effects, and so bear that in mind."
32,18044,2023-11-25,Great!,"Passion flower capsules are a stress-relief game-changer! They're natural, gentle, and don't cause grogginess. I feel more relaxed, sleep better, and wake up refreshed. Their quality is excellent, and the capsules are super easy to use. If you need a natural stress reliever or better sleep, try these capsules!"
33,18044,2023-12-01,It's MAO-inhibitor.,"It's a regular MAO-inhibitor that elevates the levels of dopamine, and well it can be uncomfortable and a bit stressing or relaxing depending on your previous mood. Personally I prefer L-theanine over this because this is a drug and has some slight confusing properties."
34,18044,2023-08-06,I use it every evening,"I love passion flowers capsules.  I take one in the evening to settle down from the day.  It is gentle and just allows your body to slow down and relax.  It is like a ""signal"" to my mind and body that it is getting time to sleep.  It also can help with anxiety during the day.  It is a necessity in my household.
"
35,18044,2023-06-21,,"Tried passionflower for insomnia, tinnitus and anxiety and was amazed at the results. Within a few days my sleep, mood and anxiety were dramatically improved. The capsules help with relaxation. However, the dose depends on your body weight. I recommend this product because it aids with lowering stress in general "
36,18044,2022-11-04,Give it a try,"Passion Flower was recommended to me by a psychiatric nurse practitioner. I take it along with Lavender. I don't know if my reaction is typical, but with Passion Flower I have lost weight because I no longer wake up in the middle of the night and want to snack."
37,18044,2023-03-20,,"I use 2 capsules at a time, it’s good supplement for relaxation but doesn’t really work for sleep (at least for me), this is if you feel stressed and anxious you take it, and there’s health benefits of taking passion flower such as antioxidants "
38,18044,2024-07-31,Tried for Anxiety ,I really wanted to like these for anxiety and honestly I’m not sure it really did anything.  I hear passion flower is beneficial for this struggling with stress but perhaps it’s not enough for anxiety. 
39,18044,2023-12-19,not feeling anything particular after taking,"Have tried the herbal tea conatining this ingredient, and it smooth my mind quite well, so I thought it might be good just buy the supplement directly.  But after taking, it does not help  or worsen my sleep. Holding neutral on this product."
40,18044,2023-06-08,Really helps with sleep!!,"I have HUGE problems sleeping, I just can't get my mind to shut off.
I recently tried Passion Flower and it really works. It helps so much with my sleep - it helps me to be 'sleepy' rather than 'tired but wide awake'.
Also when I wake in the night I can now get back to sleep much more easily.
I did need to take the two capsules (as they recommend). One capsule wasn't enough. 
Passion Flower  activates the GABA receptors in the brain, supporting relaxation.
Different people have different reasons why they can't sleep, but if you have a racing mind then this one may work for you."
41,18044,2023-02-10,,"It is a very good supplement to overall health and energy levels. The quality of both the product and packaging is amazing, and the dropper is very easy to use. The taste is not overwhelming, and I personally really use it. I'm willing to buy it again, and I trust it."
42,18044,2022-12-23,,"I think it’s good quality ingredients. I’ve been taking these for anxiety and sleep for a long time. It definitely has a way of taking an edge off and can sometimes feel like an aphrodisiac. My insomnia, however, that even these do not help anymore. Not sure about age."

I couldn't sleep though despite the drowsiness because of feeling so ill but I suspect my experience is not typical as I have chronic stomach problems and gastritis. Supplements I am ok with are lemon balm and GABA. I have given my bottle to my partner and hopefully he'll have a better experience than me!

174,18044,2009-10-25,Great for Hypertension,"I use Passion Flower for hypertension control.  Works well for that.  This brand seems to work better than the Paradise Herbs Brand high concentrate that I used to use.
Only negatives I have is wish it was more highly concentrated, or that it was 500mg caps rather than 350mg.  Maybe half whole herb and half concentrate."
175,18044,2023-08-12,nice,this extract have some minor effect that helps me to fall asleep. easy to take capsules.

179,18044,2023-03-06,,Seemed fine but not groundbreaking for relaxation. It’s a quality brand - pretty happy with NOW products in general.
180,18044,2023-02-18,,"good qualities, good ingredients, fresh, good packaging. benefits are mild. I like that is easy to take for sleep at night. "
181,18044,2023-01-21,,"Good passion flower extract, but not very strong nor a high dosage. Effective when stacked with other herbals for relaxation."
182,18044,2023-01-16,,hello there. tha product is good but i prefer other companies with 250 mg. 
183,18044,2022-11-30,,Quality is good and ingredient too. The package is also good and the benefit is that it helps me sleep.
184,18044,2020-04-26,Very effective for calming nerves,"I found this after doing some research for my mild insomnia issues where I sometimes wake up in the early morning thinking about work and my mind starts racing and I have trouble going back to bed, This product helps to minimize these events. A word of caution - stick to the serving size - especially if taken during the day - as it can make you very tired and sometimes a bit dizzy - which is fine, if taken before bed."
185,18044,2019-09-11,"Could be really good, or a little help.","Passion flower can help you with anxiety if yor case is not serious. It also helps when you are leaving medication, and that's how i use it in a normal way. Sometimes, if i feel i sleep too bad because of pain, i take one pill with my pain medicines befores going to bed, searching for a better night. It sometimes works, it sometimes not (my pain use to be really hard, so they make very difficult sleeping some nights).
 The most interesting thing with passion flower is that you may not need so many pills as the jar say. For example, when i leave some anxiety medication because my doctor thinks it's possible , i take only one pil a day, for 2-3 weeks, to ensure all be OK."
186,18044,2017-07-08,Great for relaxation,"I bought this to help control hypertension brought on by anxiety. It does help for that but one pill does not last 24 hours. I have found that if I take 1 mid morning, by early evening my BP is back up so I am going to try 2 per day for a while and see how that works. It does have a nice gentle relaxing effect. I will definitely continue to use it."
187,18044,2016-08-07,Great product for overactive minds that have trouble sleeping. new to iherb? Open my page for an exclusive offer,"I have bought sleep products that have this is it, but have found that this on its own works really well. I love the brand Now Foods and have never had any trouble ordering this from iherb and having it delivered to Australia. Great service and speedy delivery. Usually arrives via normal post in about a week. "
188,18044,2011-11-03,"Nervous system tonic, relaxing, helps sleep","Great for helping me fall asleep and has a lovely relaxing/calming effect. Some products just sedate or calm the nervous system but this herb also tonifies it. Also try valerian (if you don't mind the strong odour), skullcap and/or kava. As more general relaxing tonics rhodiola and jiaogulan are very good, but more energising (being adrenal tonics)"
189,18044,2018-06-26,"Works, but get thirsty from it","I tried whole herb before, it did not work at all, even several capsules. This extract works, but when I use it before bed, I feel thirsty in the morning, maybe because of added cellulose powder."
190,18044,2014-08-07,Great calmer,"After about an hour, my Mom who has great anxiety and fear (because of Alzheimers)' is much more relaxed and has a great day without the great feeling of fear."
191,18044,2010-04-25,Excellent product...,"Slows down my hyperactive brain during the day, and when taken at bedtime along with valerian root, I can sleep without ""working"" all night.  No nasty side effects."
192,18044,2022-09-28,جيد,"The components of the passion flower were found to be suitable for those who suffer from insomnia
"
193,18044,2023-07-15,Unter dem Durchschnitt,Passionflower made me feel the opposite of what is supposed to do. I heard that it happens with some people. I felt nervousness and insomnia. It's not about the brand but rather the effect of the herb itself. 
194,18044,2017-03-20,Dream and relaxation.,"I seem to fall to sleep easier when I've taken one of these an hour or so before bed. One thing I'm certain of though is when I do take it I have dreams every single night.  It's not a wonder sleeping pill, but definitely helps release tensions/slow the mind at night. I wouldn't take it during the day. "
195,18044,2022-02-25,,I use it to as a daily support to cakm down a bit :-) think it helps

201,18044,2013-10-02,Best sleep aid,"This is the best sleep aid I've found. Like many other herbs for sleep like Valerian, it doesn't make me get up to pee in the middle of the night. Just helps me sleep."
202,18044,2022-09-29,,love it. for me its the best stress relieve. does not cause drowsiness
203,18044,2022-08-24,,"Excellent quality and ingredients, my personal gp recommended this, it reduces my stress , like it calms my mind"
204,18044,2022-06-23,,"This supplement caused severe heart palpitations. However, this sometimes happens when I try new product. Finding the right supplements that work for me is a trial and error. Although I had to discard this product, by trying different ones I actually found some good ones along the way and I effectively manage my insomnia. Thanks to other supplements that worked I have had no sleepless night in 3 months. I was hoping to add Passionflower to the stack, but will stick to melissa, chamomile and hawthorn. But don't give up, this product might be good for you. Good luck to all insomniacs out there. "

211,18044,2018-04-16,I will buy more of this product when I have used the 3 boxes I have already bought.,"So far this product seems to work as expected (calming). Effect seems more long term than instant, meaning generally calmer after taking it daily for about a week and a half. Sleep better and even more, like up to one hour more a night."
212,18044,2014-03-21,Works for Dogs Too,"I bought this because it was recommended by a friend as a supplement for dogs to bring down anxiety. It really works. Need to be careful about the dosage though, probably not good for small dogs in this format. Maybe a tea for them."
213,18044,2011-09-16,Sleep better!,"This extract works well, I feel a little drowsiness from it, so the best idea is to use it by night, to sleep better - which I do! "

220,18044,2020-12-11,,"Best passion flower on the market as far as I'm concerned: It helped me sleep well every night for years. And cheap. However, I now read in the new description that: ""Not manufactured with yeast, wheat, gluten, soy, milk, egg, fish, shellfish or tree nut ingredients. Produced in a GMP facility that processes other ingredients containing these allergens."" This is a problem for me as a vegan as unwanted cross-contamination is possible.

I also like that passionflower does not cause drowsiness in me, it acts purposefully in a positive way. A fairly large number of capsules - enough for me for a long time. Thank you if my review was helpful to you :)"

530,18044,2024-02-14,Failed experiment,"I tried this product for anxiety, improving sleep, and stopping excessive thinking at bedtime. I took two pills, equivalent to a dose of 2400 mg, and I took two pills with the passionflower herb, equivalent to 700 mg, and there was no result at all. I think they are light herbs like chamomile and anise that have no real effect to solve the deep problem of insomnia and poor sleep and thinking. Many may benefit people who experience fleeting flashes, such as those that come when traveling, for example, so I am presenting my experience here, and it is not a medical recommendation in any way. The only treatment that I have benefited from in solving these problems for a long time is the drug Cipralex. I used it for 4 months, left it, and the condition improved completely. The excessive thinking disappeared, sleep improved, anxiety went away, the colon improved, self-confidence increased, and its excellent effects remained for about 8 months. Then the condition returned mildly and I used these herbs to no avail. Therefore, I advise seeing a psychiatrist to solve these problems. He will often put you on Cipralex from 6 months to a year. In fact, I advise not to ignore it. These problems are because a person who sleeps well improves his life greatly
