7,132556,2024-10-10,It would be a problem if we didn't have it,"I can't sleep if my pillow is changed, so I used to get insufficient sleep while traveling, but since I started using melatonin, I don't have that problem anymore. I use it every day, and it's helpful because it doesn't make me feel sluggish the next day like sleeping pills do. I feel that it's more effective when it contains relaxing ingredients such as theanine. I'm in trouble if I don't have it, so I stock up on it."
8,132556,2024-05-19,I think it's working,"Rather than being sticky, it has a light texture with a low moisture content. The taste is a little peculiar, but it doesn't bother me. I think 30 minutes have passed since I ate this, brushed my teeth, and finished getting ready for bed, so I can fall asleep smoothly. I feel like I wake up less often during the night. I've already bought it three times, and I wish it had a higher moisture content, but I'm generally satisfied."
