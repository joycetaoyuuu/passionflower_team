0,121210,2024-06-06,Zum Products Rock,"Most lotion leaves me feeling greasy but they have improved this product over the years and now I can use it and not have the greasy after effect. Zum products all smell great. They must use quality essential oils because they smell authentic, not like synthetic perfume that gives you a headache. I just talked about the scent. What is up with this review program."
1,121210,2024-04-25,Favorite patchouli lotion! ,Love the way it smells and the consistency of lotion. It's easily absorbed into the skin and makes my skin look and feel radiant. Also love the fact that it's a squeeze bottle because many other lotions come in a pump and it's so hard to get lotion out of the bottle. Great product for the price! 
2,121210,2024-01-16,Lovely Texture,"shea butter and jojoba oil is very moisturising, love the texture of this good quality handcream with a size thats easy to carry around, makes my hand soft and smelling nice. great for sensitive skin"
3,121210,2024-10-16,Absolutely love this,The smell is amazing and refreshing. Great size tube. great quality brand. Lasting moisture. Does have a strong scent but does tone down over time.
4,121210,2024-08-21,incredible!,best ingredients by far makes my skin healthy and glowy a little goes a long way! just makes me feel wonderful with its beautiful scent!
5,121210,2024-06-16,Love Zum,"Fabulous fragrance,lovely moisturiser. Just love Zum products. The scent really lasts and stays fresh and the blend is generous and kind to the skin."
6,121210,2024-04-28,Best patchouli sent ,"Love this lotion. After Kiss My Face discontinued their patchouli lotion, I struggled to find another with this level of scent. This smells even better and is thicker. More moisturizing."
7,121210,2024-02-17,Love the scent!,It‚Äôs a scent that you probably either love or hate. I love it. Reminds me of hippies in the 1960s! The product itself absorbs well into the skin and doesn‚Äôt leave any slippery residue. 
8,121210,2023-12-23,Effective and Good-Smelling,Second time purchasing this hand & body lotion.  Effective.  Adds moisture to my perpetually dry winter weather hands.  The patchouli does not overpower; the scent is subtle enough that I don't feel like a crunchie hippie when wearing this at work.  The package lasts a long time.
9,121210,2023-11-09,strong fragrance,"It feels like an ordinary lotion which uses daily, just can't stand the strong and long lasting scent. Not a friend of the scent. I like the scent is light even though it is my favorite scent. I saw the review and the ratings were good. over expected I guess. "
10,121210,2024-09-14,good lotion,"this lotion has a good scent and good quality,good price for the size. I use it everyday. love this product is not tested on animals.Easy to order and reorder

"
11,121210,2023-11-29,Interesting ,"The scent is interesting,  not truly patchouli.  It reminded my friends of a old fragrance they enjoyed from the past.
The cream is thick and rich. You would have to smell it to see for yourself.  I'm not sorry I got it but probably won't order again.
"
12,121210,2024-02-06,,"i love all of zum's other scents, but this one..not so much.. plus it smelled old.. i love patchouli oil, but not this! ill stick with the frankensense and myhrr!"
13,121210,2023-10-13,OMG I Can't Get Enough Of This,"I love the scent of this lotion and it feels amazing on your skin. I bought two because I don't want to be without it! If you don't like patchouli, choose another scent. I happen to love it (guess I'm just an older hippie) and the aroma is not overpowering - just a light scent of patchouli. It is just divine and moisturizes my dry skin really well, especially in the winter."
14,121210,2024-09-30,,"NO complaints! Great product, nice scent-not overpowering, no greasy residue. Good quantity for price. Will purchase again!"
15,121210,2024-09-29,,I love the smell of this cream and it makes my hand skin is soft . Will buy again 
16,121210,2024-09-28,,"Very nice fragrance, not too strong. And absorbs well. Would recommend."
17,121210,2024-09-15,Patchouli,"Scent is ok, absorbs quickly. Zum quality is always fine. Nice product"
18,121210,2024-09-05,,This one smells okay. but it does make my skin soft and has clean ingredients. 
19,121210,2024-08-13,LOVE THE SMELL OF THE PATCHOULI CREAM,"This has a great Patchouli smell which stays on my skin, I use it after my morning shower and only need a small amount"
20,121210,2024-06-26,ZUM Hand Lotion ,Excellent product.  Smells great and works well.  Also the price at iHerb is much cheaper than even Amazon.  
21,121210,2024-04-29,,smells amazing...my hair feels amazing...just use a little 
22,121210,2024-04-04,great lotion,"great scent,use a little it 
goes a long way,quality lotion and pretty big tube size"
23,121210,2024-03-04,Smells Amazing,"First off, shipping was extremely fast!  I order the soap as well and both smell fabulous right out of the box!  "
24,121210,2024-02-17,Too strongly scented,"I bought this because I love the scent of patchouli but in mild doses. There were a number of reviews that said this was mildly scented, which is TOTALLY wrong. My guess is those individuals love patchouli so much that they are perhaps desensitized to how strong the lotion actually is. One tiny drop, and I mean TINY drop is enough to scent my house. I basically can't wear it out of respect for others who may not like the smell (and there are a lot). I was hoping for a lotion that was so subtle in scent someone had to hug you to get a whiff. I would love a refund for this, but it isn't worth my time to mail this back for a refund. Sad..."
25,121210,2024-01-16,All about the smell!,The scent of this lotion is great!  I also love that it absorbs quickly and works well for me.
26,121210,2023-12-31,If you Love Patchouli‚Ä¶,Oh this is THE ONE if you love patchouli‚Ä¶.. it is quite arousing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Buy some if you want the mood to be set!!
27,121210,2024-05-03,good ingredients,I like zum products...they have quality ingredients and always smell wonderful
28,121210,2024-04-25,good product,"small good, soft in skin,  Wish had more small on this....."
29,121210,2023-08-26,Love Patchouli!,"I use this ZUM hand lotion sparingly because while I love the patchouli scent, others may not (I have no idea why üòâ).  I was happy to find it at iHerb!"
30,121210,2024-09-01,Average,"The size is big, It feels good and absorbs quickly, but the scent is very unpleasant for me "
31,121210,2024-01-12,Good moisturizer ,It's a good moisturizer but the smell is really unpleasant and I'm not really a picky person when it comes to smells. 
32,121210,2023-07-27,Yuuumm,This leaves me feeling so moisturized and the smell lingers just enough without being overpowering. Love it.
33,121210,2023-07-05,,Yummy earthy scent! The bottle was bigger than I expected.

35,121210,2023-11-28,You might not like the scent of patchouli!,"I didn't know about the scent of patchouli, but I searched online and it looked good, so I decided to buy it. I think the quality of the lotion is good. When you apply it, it's not sticky and feels very moisturizing. There isn't a lot of it as a body lotion, so I plan to use it as a hand cream, but unfortunately I don't really like the patchouli scent."
36,121210,2024-09-08,Lightweight and comfortable to use,"I love other products and the scent is patchouli, which is my favorite, so I was excited to buy it! I was worried that the scent might be a matter of personal preference, so if it's too strong, it might be hard to use on a daily basis, but the scent is gentle enough that I can use it during the day. The size is not too big and easy to carry around. It's moisturizing, but not sticky, so it's easy to use."
37,121210,2024-06-30,It's my favorite scent,"I bought this because the ZUM packaging is cute and I like the scent of patchouli. I apply it after taking a bath, so I think I can get a good night's sleep surrounded by my favorite patchouli scent. I also like that the scent is almost gone by morning. The cream has a soft texture and isn't too sticky, so I use it in the hot seasons. I can also feel the moisturizing effect, so I use it all year round."
38,121210,2024-03-11,For those who like patchouli,"I order all products from this brand that contain patchouli. The smell is rich, but not pure patchouli, what else is added is so tart, but I am already used to these products with such patchouli. The closest thing to pure patchouli in ZUM is the patchouli aroma spray, this body and hand cream, I currently use it for hands, for the body it can be used as an aroma additive with another odorless cream, then it will be more patchouli, not so concentrated"
39,121210,2024-02-22,Patchouli~‚ô™,"The scent of patchouli is the best‚ô™ At first, it has an earthy smell, but as time passes, the patchouli fully opens up, and when you move, you can smell it instantly.If you apply it to your hands, feet, and decollete, you don't need a body fragrance‚ô™Ingredients It's very good and has a moisturizing effect that can be used regardless of the season‚ô™ It may be a little weak to use for hand care, but it's large and cost-effective, so you can use it as often as you like‚ô™"
40,121210,2023-11-13,unusual,"I liked the composition, which is why I bought it. The packaging is convenient, for any age, there will definitely be benefits. At first the smell seemed extremely pungent, dry, and very specific. Patchouli is like that. I smeared my hands with caution a couple of times, but it reveals itself very interestingly on me. Tart, warm, thick - more interesting every time. I recommend it to those who love essential oils and patchouli."
41,121210,2023-10-29,strong patchouli,"Purchased at the same time as frankincense and myrrh. Patchouli is often said to have an ink scent, but this patchouli was an earthy patchouli. It's a very calming scent, but it seems to have a very different taste. It feels good to apply. Your skin will become soft and fluffy."
42,121210,2023-11-09,For patchouli lovers,"I like patchouli scents, but the patchouli flavor is a bit strong. It has a unique scent like the ground after rain. It feels moist when applied, spreads well, and stays moisturized for a long time. The size is bigger than I expected. Cannot be carried around. There's plenty of it, so you can use it as much as you want."
43,121210,2023-11-12,Strong smell,Excellent quality and easy to use. Medium size. Smell. Small toys. I hope it will be useful. Age and composition. Useful and natural. Mahdi Perfume Oil. Sense. Composition. Benefit. Package.
44,121210,2024-09-09,,"I like the ink-like scent of patchouli and was looking for a perfume, but this cream has a gentle scent that comes from the body, so I can use it regardless of the time, place, and occasion. I really like the scent."
45,121210,2024-09-01,Hand moisturizer ,"Hello, good evening and good morning to you all. The cream is nice, light and moisturizing, but I didn‚Äôt like its smell very much. 
"
46,121210,2024-07-10,Zum Products,"I love Zumu products. They have a nice scent and spread easily. Immediately after use, they have a woody smell, but as time goes on, it becomes better."
47,121210,2024-06-29,good smell,I bought this because I love the scent of patchouli. It's a thick cream that spreads easily. It really does have the herbaceous scent of patchouli.
48,121210,2024-03-21,wonderful,"The scent is amazing! The texture is more like a cream than a lotion. I think it's best to use it in winter. It moisturizes very well. It smells like a forest after it rains. I like green colors more than flower colors, so I really liked this."
49,121210,2024-02-05,really like,"Use as a hand cream. Everyone says it smells good. I love this patchouli and can't get rid of it. Although it is lightweight, it is moisturizing and reduces the dryness of my hands. very easy to apply"
50,121210,2024-06-14,The scent,"I like the scent of the laundry detergent from the same brand, so I was excited to find a body lotion with the same scent and bought it, but the scent was different from what I imagined. As a body cream, it contains natural ingredients and does not cause any skin problems and is moisturizing, but I was a little disappointed because I was interested in the scent."
51,121210,2023-11-15,Highly moisturizing,"I think this is a highly moisturizing cream. The moist feeling continues. The scent of patchouli is natural, but it's patchouli. I love the smell of earth, but I think there are many people who don't like it."
52,121210,2024-05-08,Great scent,I love all products from this brand! I like its fragrance very much and will use it often.
53,121210,2024-06-09,,"The smell is very good, the quality is high, the size is medium, and the effectiveness of the ingredients is excellent "
54,121210,2024-09-05,,"I didn't like the feel of it when I used it. It was a bit sticky. It smelled just like patchouli, so people's preferences for the scent will be quite divided."
55,121210,2024-07-02,The scent is not so good,"It's a light cream that provides plenty of moisture. However, the scent is like ink, which I didn't like very much. The texture is recommended for summer."
56,121210,2023-07-14,,"I didn‚Äôt really like the smell too tart.. the quality is not bad, the price is too much for such a cream... the packaging is large, the composition is not bad ... I bought it only because of the smell of patchouli, but it is too strong.. and so the product is not bad"
57,121210,2024-09-01,This brand of soap is the best,"Will apply it on the body, but it doesn't stick, the smell is a bit old school."
58,121210,2024-05-24,The scent,"I bought a lot of patchouli from Zum, but this one has the lightest patchouli scent. It smelled like oily clay mixed with the oily scent of the lotion. I can still smell the earthiness of the patchouli. The quality of the lotion is not sticky and easy to apply, but it seems to dry quickly after application."
59,121210,2024-04-24,,"Product of good quality, texture and aroma. Good size and absorbs easily into the skin."
60,121210,2023-12-02,a veil of softness,sweet and quality fragrance. pleasant texture. Effective moisturizing treatment to use daily. .
61,121210,2024-04-03,The smell is subtle,"I really like frankincense & patchouli detergents, so I tried this, but the patchouli alone was a bit too strong for my taste. It smelled like grass."
62,121210,2024-10-17,The patchouli!,"For those who use patchouli in detergent, it smells just like patchouli (ink?). It feels normal to use."
63,121210,2024-06-02,The scent of earth,"It was non-sticky and easy to use, but although I like the scent of patchouli, it was a bit too earthy for me."
64,121210,2023-12-02,,The smell is unpleasant. Easy to use. The quality is very good. The size of the package is large. Do not repeat purchases
65,121210,2023-08-16,,"I‚Äôm already buying the second one, I really like it, I feel natural oils, the consistency is perfect"
66,121210,2023-11-26,,"Unfortunately, it smells bad. I expected it to be like laundry soap, but it turned out different. I do not recommend it at all"
67,121210,2023-07-28,,"The smell is beautiful, the quality is fluid, the size is appropriate, and the packaging is of a suitable size"
68,121210,2023-10-16,Delights,I love the scent and appearance of the cream
