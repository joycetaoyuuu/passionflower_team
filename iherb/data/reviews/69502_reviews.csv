10,69502,2023-12-10,Not sure that works,"I am not sure that it works because I have 2 kids and it seems to work only for one of them. What I see happening is that one of my children becomes a bit drowsy. However, her sleep is not calm, and wakes up or turns a lot during sleep. This happened also before taking this product, so I don't think that the products have side effects. "
11,69502,2024-09-29,Satisfied,My kid didn't like the taste earlier but now he takes it easily and its very helpful. His sleep got better. Quality is good but the dropper must have mentioned the serving size.
12,69502,2024-08-24,Good ,My little is able to overcome this but at least she’s able to longer than before. I guess it varies from individual to individual 
13,69502,2024-04-21,Does what it described,It does what it described but only thing it has after taste. My son said its bitter. Hope there's not that much after taste of it. That's why I took one star off.

15,69502,2024-03-14,Doesn't seem to work,"I think this has quality ingredients, and it is safe for all ages, but I honestly don't think it works at all. I followed dosage instructions for 3 different ages, and even gave more, and in two dosages for vefore bed. I didn't notice any difference in the kids. It did not help them fall asleep or calm down. "
16,69502,2023-12-27,Not as great as I thought,"I bought this product and the lemon balm first of all in hope and 2nd after reading some nice reviews...well, I am really sorry do not have the same experience like the ones that I read .
This product doesn't even make my lil one sleepy,let alone improving her sleep.she takes longer to fall asleep and wakes up more often than before.
One fact that I noticed which wasn't happening before is when she wakes up in the night time she cries,as she would have nightmare,she still wakes up 4-5 times/night. So dissapointed "

198,69502,2019-09-04,"Useful herbs, but do not greatly affect falling asleep","I try on my sleepy daughter everything that comes across for a child's sleep. We are 4 years old, we have neurological problems, we are treating, but with sleep, the doctors do not offer us anything. These droplets are made entirely from herbs known for their soothing effects. We did not get the desired effect, but I still think that the drops are useful, perhaps, they improve sleep itself, there is a slight sedative effect. That is, he does not jump in bed for two hours, but for the same two hours he talks quietly and sings songs while lying down."
199,69502,2017-03-26,"Alas, not our option","A glass vial and a glass pipette. The photo below is a pipette that is smaller and without divisions. The taste of pleasant drops is grass with orange. There is no alcohol in the composition, the basis is from the description ""Certified Organic Vegetable Glycerin and Distilled Water"".


The child drinks drops even from a teaspoon. Give 5 drops an hour before the expected sleep, then give a drink than anything. Dissolve in water is not an option, we can always refuse. Tested in 2 long visits every week for sure. Alas, not our option. As he sang songs and played in the crib, he plays. Maybe someone will work with it, but other variants work well with us, so these drops will have to be again in the refrigerator, maybe we'll try it in the third set."
200,69502,2021-04-28,,"It is a product that is needed for children, so I always buy it from iHerb. I would like a lot of these products in the future"

205,69502,2023-02-01,,"It doesn't work for my child, it feels almost the same as when I didn't eat it"
206,69502,2021-09-07,,It doesn’t work for me. It’s different from the usual time to fall asleep. It’s more effective to put enough electricity than to eat supplement.
