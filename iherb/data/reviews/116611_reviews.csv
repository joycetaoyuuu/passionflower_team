0,116611,2024-01-09,It works!,This stuff WORKS! Wild cherry bark is the big daddy of taking down coughs and passionfruit really does aid in helping my little get to sleep. The ingredients in this brands products are impeccable.  Anytime my kid has a cough I use this and it's effective every time! The taste isn't too bad (although my kid is used to eating raw garlic). The quality you get for the price is outstanding. The size of the package is also perfect because it last a very long while. Especially since I paired it with the AM! I will absolutely be repurchasing.
