0,134216,2024-02-17,It really works!!,I've been taking Relaxium Sleep for a few years and wouldn't go without it. It not only helps with my quality of sleep but also helps with my energy and mood. Highly recommend!! I also like the fact that it has all natural ingredients and non habit forming. 
1,134216,2024-03-30,Sleep supplement ,My husband uses these to help relax and sleep but not every day. He breaks them open and puts in applesauce because he doesnâ€™t like to swallow pills.  He says sometimes they upset his stomach. He has tried a couple other brands and all about the same. Ok but not 5 stars. 
2,134216,2024-05-16,Sleep Aid,"Not a real fan of this product,
but it does include a fair variety of ingredients.
Ouch, could do without the magnesium stearate though.
Do not buy the cloned counterfeit on the market that does not show the UPC 857431003397."
