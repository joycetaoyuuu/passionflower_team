0,14534,2023-10-28,Helps My Insomnia,"Great for helping me fall asleep & stay asleep.  When stress is high, I add in melatonin to help me fall asleep. Everyone is different, so I hope this helps you! I've tried other products over the years and this one is excellent. I have used it for about 10 days."
1,14534,2024-06-19,I use this a lot. And it works great for me. ,I trust this brand more than most others so try to use their products whenever I can. I feel safer knowing there are no extra things thrown in. And they always smell great too. Healthy smelling. Herby. They might cost more but I feel it‚Äôs worth it to feel safe. 
2,14534,2024-05-22,GAIA HERBS,"I have tried many different kinds of natural sleep supplements and this one works well. However, I find it the effect wears off after a few weeks so I stop for a while and then resume. That is purely my personal experience"
3,14534,2024-05-06,I was surprised .. in a good way,"I had to sleep in a strange place .. I'm quite sleepless .. the jar says 3 capsules which seems too much I took 2 capsules and fortunately I slept! I will definitely try again, was it a coincidence.. the price of the jar is very expensive if you have to use 3 capsules at once"
4,14534,2024-01-12,Wonderful company and product ,This is a great mix of herbs from a reputable company. They work well and are typically safe for use. I have been using some combination of these herbs from Gaia for 17 years now. 
5,14534,2024-01-02,Melatonin-free supplement,"Review after one month of use.
Is my first time with the Gaia Herbs brand and their type of herbal  release called Liquid Phyto-Caps¬Æ and the impression was positive. Capsules of standard size and not difficult to swallow. To be considered that the dosage involves the use of 3 capsules. 
The product is indicated for occasional cases and not for severe causes, since when one cannot sleep the causes can be different and related to excessive stress, too hectic life, excessive exercise etc... 
In my case this supplement made only with herbal ingredients (California Poppy, Skullcap, and Passionflower) and without melatonin has been helpful.

"
6,14534,2024-07-24,ok,"120 count bottle would have been much cheaper per capsule. ""screened for pesticides, microbes & heavy metals."" that's good but bad that other products don't have this."
7,14534,2024-02-08,"Gaia Herbs, Sound Sleep","While this mixture of herbs is in capsules, I often let it dissolve in my mouth.  Wow, the taste is great.  And Gaia is always potent in its extraction.  I take this about 1 hour before bed."
8,14534,2023-12-29,"Gaia Herbs, Sound Sleep","Gaia Herbs Sound Sleep supports restful sleep with a blend of herbs like valerian, passionflower, and California poppy. This formula may calm the mind, ease tension, and promote a healthy sleep cycle. Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on incorporating this supplement into your sleep routine."
9,14534,2023-11-29,Great product,Gaia is a great line of supplements & I love Sound Sleep. I have been using it for years & it works for me. The ingredients is perfect & helps me to calm down & have a restful sleep. 
10,14534,2023-11-13,Works for me.,"Sleep issues vary among people, so one product doesn't fit all. I've tried many sleep support products and this blend of herb from gaia has been working well for me. I like that it is melatonin free, so I can add melatonin in as needed."
11,14534,2023-10-25,Recommend ,I was having a lot of trouble getting sleep after my baby was born even when I was able to sleep. Took this product for about three months and saw an improvement and getting into the deep rim cycles
12,14534,2024-09-26,Not for me,Gaia is a company that I trust with high quality ingredients. Having said that this product did not help me sleep better and I used it with Gaia Sleep Thru. Having said that I have had bad insomnia my whole life and I am a tough nut to crack. Some might find this beneficial.
13,14534,2024-03-04,Slept well!,I tried this product since I have had many years of waking up between 3-5 am and can‚Äôt fall back to sleep.  Worked well the first time with 3 caps.  I slept 7 hours and was able to fall asleep again.  Not such great results when I tried 2 caps.  
14,14534,2024-01-27,Seems to help with insomnia...,"Seems like an effective herbal combination for insomnia.     I combine it with other products for night time anxiety and insomnia.    Because of its expense, I can only afford to take one cap a night.    Gaia produces very good products and is very trustworthy but pricey.    "
15,14534,2024-02-02,"it works when you first take it, but after continueous use it loses the effect","i'd say it definitely is better than the other brands (probably due to the high passionflower concentration) but your body develops a resistance to it rather quick 

i'd say this is okay and nothing more, at least the ingredients are quality and it goes down smooth. "
16,14534,2024-09-27,Love this product!,Been taking this for years and it really helps me fall asleep.
17,14534,2024-09-22,The best sleep aid for falling asleep,This supplement is the best I have found for occasional insomnia. 1-2 capsules before bed help to calm the mind.

41,14534,2023-12-25,Good product ,I compared this with another herbal product. I think this is effective just wish it was less expensive 
42,14534,2023-09-24,Works great!,"Sound sleep, taken at bedtime, helps me get back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night.   In the morning, I wake up feeling rested and it's much better than prescription sleep meds."

44,14534,2023-08-26,Awesome for Sleeplessness,"I've been taking this product off and on for a few years now.  I have issues falling asleep and staying asleep.

I love it...it works for me and keeps me from having to take an actual sleeping pill."
45,14534,2023-07-18,Sound sleep,Works like a charm every night I need to take it. Make sure to take it an hour before bed for it to kick in. Ingredients were exactly what I was looking for.
46,14534,2024-05-21,Zero effect,"I‚Äôve taken this for 3 nights in a row and they have zero effect on my body. I suffer from insomnia every now and then so I thought I would try this. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt work for me. "
47,14534,2023-11-13,Gaia herbs,My doctor told me to start with one pill a night and if it didn‚Äôt help to try two. I could take up to 3 a night. I was taking 3 a night and it didn‚Äôt help me sleep through the night.
48,14534,2023-10-31,Sleep supplement,"This product really did not work for me. You can take up to 3 a night, which I did with Melatonin and I still wake up at night several times with difficulty going back to sleep."

and, makes the following day more productive!!"
50,14534,2021-11-21,For post acute withdrawal syndrome ,"Took 3 at night amd occasionally throughout the day for benzodiazepine post acute withdrawal (after 4 weeks with no benzo). Definitely helps. I was getting 2-3 hours sleep a night. Immediately after taking i got 5 hours and it only got better. Absolute godsend as neither the doctors nor drug service helped AT ALL

"
51,14534,2024-10-08,My Doctor recommended,My Doctor recommended and  It helps but I was hoping for more.  ( I have lots of health issues so it just could be me)
52,14534,2023-03-17,,I have ADHD kids.  They struggle to sleep at night.  Sound sleep has worked well for both of them when other natural ingredient remedies just were not doing it.  Well worth the cost for more settled nights!  
53,14534,2022-11-17,,"Normally I love the Gaia product, but this particular formula for sleeping does not work so well for me.

But it may work for you.

Good quality extract and ingredients.

"
54,14534,2023-08-18,,"Suggested use

Adults take 2-3 capsules 1 hour before bed.

Very good quality "
55,14534,2023-06-22,,Taken occasionally helps with a good night sleep.  Sleep rather deep and long.
56,14534,2023-06-08,Helps,This helps my husband relax and fall asleep. No negative side effects.
57,14534,2023-10-01,Seems to help,I found these moderately effective in helping me get to sleep at night. 
58,14534,2023-06-07,Good quality sleep supplement,"Not quite strong enough for my type of insomnia, but I do feel that it helps. No side effects."
59,14534,2023-01-15,,"I love the formula, unfortunately it takes something way stronger and compounded by myself to help me sleep."
60,14534,2019-07-24,Sound Sleep  is the best sleep aid I‚Äôve ever used,Sound  Sleep really works so gently to let you relax and fall asleep and then in the morning you awake very refreshed without any hangover feeling  like you get from  other sleep aids I‚Äôve tried. You awake feeling really refreshed and well-rested. This is by far the best sleep aid I‚Äôve ever used and I‚Äôve been using it for years for the occasional night I struggle to fall asleep .
61,14534,2011-10-24,It works!,"It really helps. Especially if you are really stressed, or on edge, or just not able to sleep. Sometimes I felt a little groggy the next day, or almost a little depressed, so take one instead of two, as the directions call for. Overall, I think it is good for you, & has a positive effect on the body."
62,14534,2010-01-18,Great product.,A friend and health store owner suggested this to me after experiencing a few damaged cervical discs in an accident.  It really helped at the time and now I only use it on rare occasions.  It is another wonderful find that is safe and natural.  I am so glad iherb carries quality familiar brands I can trust.
63,14534,2022-04-21,,It's calms  the nervous system down but it does not really put you to sleep if you have woken up in the middle of the night
64,14534,2018-01-10,Best Sleep Aid Ever,"I have used this item before now and don't want to be without it.  I don't always need it while home but if I feel the need I know it is safe and worth having around for a good night of sleep.  I don't travel as much as I used to however when I do I have trouble sleeping the first night in a different place/bed.  That is no longer an issue with this awesome product.  I won't leave home without it in that case.
"
65,14534,2016-08-22,Best sleep ever,"I love the poppy, skullcap, and valerian mix. Seriously makes the difference and the fact that it's glycerin. One takes the edge off and 2 keeps me asleep at least for 4-6 hrs. It's so hard to sleep so sucking on the first pull then swallowing the next let's one instantly kick in and the other sets in as I'm falling asleep. This is the only sleeping pill that works for me! Love it!"
66,14534,2009-03-04,Works well,"Since Sound Sleep takes a while to kick in, it only works if you take it early- 1 1/2 to 2 hours before going to bed.  It seems to lower my blood pressure and help switch my mind ""off,"" making it easier to fall asleep.  That also means that I don't wake up groggy.  I highly recommend this product!

"
67,14534,2023-08-14,,"High quality, very smooth effect, take it before sleep, it‚Äôs give me more deep sleep! "
68,14534,2018-01-25,Blessing,This product is a blessing.  I struggle with my sleep and when I take this taa daa no problems sleeping.  So thank full that I found this product at Iherb
69,14534,2011-03-16,amazing product,"This mix of herbs relaxes me when stressed and helps me sleep deeply at night, more so than any other product I have tried. I just take one (label says take 2) and it works perfectly. Highly recommended."
70,14534,2010-03-25,Zzzzzzzzzz for MS,"My husband has difficulty sleeping because of MS and found prescription drugs to be more harm than help, but Gaia Herbs Sound Sleep has been working for him without any side effects."
71,14534,2009-09-01,"It helps, taken correctly","This is not a knock-out sleeping pill.  This product does help, though, if you take it and go to bed right away.  If you take it and stay up, it will just make you feel relaxed."
72,14534,2022-08-27,Really nice dosage ,I appreciate the level of care and thought put into this blend. It helps me to stay asleep and no groggy morning feeling. 
73,14534,2022-07-10,,I love these extracts from Gaia herbs. This one is helpful to me for sleep and calming.
74,14534,2022-03-01,,It is really important to get good rest & this product helps me sleep.
75,14534,2017-11-01,Best sleep in a long time!,"I have tried many herbal sleep remedies over the years. This one by far surpasses them all!
One capsule is more than enough to give me deep sound sleep. So glad I found this!!!"
76,14534,2021-01-17,,"Bought this for my husband. He uses it with some l-theonine tablets (which he has used for a long time on their own), and he has noticed improved sleep using the two together."
77,14534,2016-09-05,Did not Work Too Well,"I find the Sleep Thru and Nightly Restore better than this.  I am a little leery about the Kava in it, as it is supposed to be hard on your liver."
78,14534,2022-09-11,,"I didn‚Äôt like it that much. I didn‚Äôt feel the difference. The quality is ok, I guess. "
79,14534,2011-05-24,Sound sleep!,"So far, this is the best sleep product I've tried."

92,14534,2021-12-17,,Helps me. Taken half an hour before bed. 
93,14534,2017-12-19,Gaia's sound sleep,This did not work for me. Usually I like the quality of Gaia herbs. So far Valerian root phyto caps by Gaia works for me. I'm looking  for another product to alternate so my body won't develop resistance to one product. 
94,14534,2012-07-17,This doesn't do a thing for me..,"Admittedly, when I need to sleep.. I'll hope and pray 10mg of melatonin will work for me.

This was a waste of my time and money."
95,14534,2009-02-24,Didn't work for me...,"...but that doesn't mean it won't work for someone else. We all have different reasons behind why we don't sleep well or easily. I wish I could return it and I plan to stay with the Seditol, which works much better for me."
96,14534,2016-12-01,Helps with sleep,"This product does help with sleep, but it gives me weird dreams!"
97,14534,2009-09-30,Gaia Herbs Review,This product arrived in excellent condition. It also arrived in a very timely fashion. I would definitely order from this company again.

103,14534,2009-11-12,sleep,very efffective
104,14534,2024-06-08,Benefit and quality.,"On the first night I didn‚Äôt feel any results at all and suffered from insomnia until the morning. On the second night of treatment, I immediately fell asleep, but I had such incredible dreams that in the morning my head was square. It was very difficult to wake up. On the third night there was no effect again. Well, maybe the sleep itself is stronger, but falling asleep is a problem."
105,14534,2024-10-14,Wow ,"I have always wanted to buy this sleep-aiding ingredient. It is good for sleep, good news for those who eat low-carb diets, helps you fall asleep peacefully and restore a healthy life. I am grateful for the good quality and safe quantity. The liquid capsules are easy to absorb."
106,14534,2024-09-05,Good sleep,"A natural supplement designed to support healthy sleep. It contains a blend of herbal extracts such as valerian, hops and chamomile, which are known for their calming properties."

108,14534,2024-07-14,,The quality of the ingredients is top notch. The size of the capsules is not large. I have not yet felt the taste and benefits.
109,14534,2023-12-30,Great,I take it only during periods of severe stress and when I can‚Äôt sleep and have restless sleep. It's easier to sleep with this supplement.
110,14534,2024-05-09,The smell is strong,"I bought this with high expectations because it is a brand with great quality, but the smell was terrible just by opening the bottle, and the capsules had an even stronger smell, which I couldn't handle. I can handle herbal smells, but this one was a bit too much for me. However, it is a good product, so it may be good for those who don't mind the smell."
111,14534,2024-01-30,the result was not surprising,"It calmed me down, but didn‚Äôt eliminate my insomnia. it eventually turned out that it was caused by deficiencies. If the deficit was removed, the insomnia went away. "
112,14534,2023-09-11,Amazing,The mixture of these sleep supplements has become my reliable companion in the fight against insomnia. They help me relax and improve the quality of my sleep.

135,14534,2017-08-11,Bad,"I do not sleep. And there was a lot of awakening again at dawn, and I wake up in the morning. Moreover, if I eat this, I have a strange dream. I even tried to eat one of them before I went to bed, but I ate a whole meal, but I ate all three of them, and the snow drifted away in the early morning ... I guess it surely does not fit in my body. Other foreigners usually appreciate the evaluation ... There is also a price range, so I bought it and it is the worst product for me. For reference, I am not sleeping with insomnia and nervousness."
