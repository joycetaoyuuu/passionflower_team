0,59337,2024-02-20,Fantastic ,"After using this for just a few days, I noticed a significant improvement in the condition of my hands. The formula effectively moisturized dry patches and softened rough areas, leaving my skin feeling velvety-smooth and nourished. It also helped to relieve irritation and redness, making it ideal for sensitive skin types."
1,59337,2024-01-02,,"This lemon scented lotion is so good! It smells like a really fragrant real lemon. It is moisturizing enough to be applied in dry winter and does not cause any breakouts. I mainly apply it to my body, but my child and husband are very satisfied with the fact that they can apply it to their face as well and it stays moisturized without causing any problems."
2,59337,2023-10-28,Lovely Lemon!,"First let me say that my bathroom is full of 99% of Desert Essence products. This lotion is what I use year round after showering. The scent is so yummy, but light. The scent does fade away, but that‚Äôs good. You don‚Äôt want artificial chemicals in your lotion being applied to your skin. It leaves your skin moisturized and smooth. "

The bottle sits on the cap, so it's easy to get all the lotion out.

"
13,59337,2023-06-10,,"This product has a pleasant scent. There is a good amount of the product. It seems to have good moisturizing ability, however, I found it to be a bit tacky for longer than I like to be tacky ;). It is humid. I found it much more pleasant than the body butter from another seller."

33,59337,2023-08-31,Smells Nice,The lemon scent is nice but not strong enough for me. I will add a little lemon oil to it to see if will bring out more of a lemony scent.  The texture of the lotion is thick enough for me. I like it.
34,59337,2023-10-06,Clean lemon scent,The fresh lemon scent is strong right out of the tube but not so  much once applied to the skin. I love that it's rich and really moisturizes dry skin but at the same time not too greasy.
35,59337,2023-10-02,Love it!,"At first I thought that smell is going to be very strong, but turned out that it is so good! If you will buy this you will be smelling as a lemon pie. Also I think that dessert essence has the best body lotions!"

40,59337,2023-06-12,Perfect!,"The smell of lemon peel oil makes this one pleasant on the skin‚Ä¶ like the fact that they use Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil & Shea Butter‚Ä¶ skin feels revitalized‚Ä¶"
41,59337,2023-05-27,lemony lotion,"desert essence has got to be my favorite lotion makers. i was eager to try a new scent after loving the coconut version. this didn‚Äôt disappoint. lovely notes of lemon peel and sweet cream, thick but not too much so, hydrating and soothing for dry hands. "
42,59337,2023-04-18,,I use it during summer season it works really good on my sensitive skin and the texture of this is pretty thick so it‚Äôs instance moisturize I like the scent and also the size is nice 
43,59337,2022-10-26,,"Lovely fresh lemon scent (not artificial smelling). Very thick and a bit soapy which is fine for me as I have really dry skin, but might not suit everyone."
44,59337,2024-05-21,meh,This smelled great in the tube but unfortunately seemed to change about a minute after application 
45,59337,2022-08-07,,"Great lotion, very smooth texture and has a very nice scent. The package size is a bit big for hand cream, but it is also a body lotion. High quality, I really enjoy this lotion and use it a lot."

47,59337,2023-02-24,,Awesome product and natural. Nice scent. The smell derived from an organic source. Daily use. Away from harmful chemical. 
48,59337,2022-04-22,,"This is an ok moisturizer for me. Moisturises well, doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin or cause body acne. It absorbs reasonably well, and the texture is so-so, not too heavy but not the lightest either. The fragrance is kinda artificial lemon, though thankfully not as bad as the cleaning products lemon smell. It also doesn‚Äôt linger, which is great. Finished it but not going to repurchase cause having a lightweight texture is a must for me and sadly this doesn‚Äôt really meet that criteria."
49,59337,2022-05-13,,"Great lotion, very smooth texture and has a very nice scent. The package size is a bit big for hand cream, but it is also a body lotion. High quality, I really enjoy this lotion and use it a lot. "
50,59337,2023-11-28,Good scent,We used to buy this brand all the time. But we recently discovered that they put Aluminum in their lotions. So we quit buying it. I would research the health risks of Aluminum. Even small amounts accumulate.

58,59337,2023-07-11,,"Citrusy scent, good deal. I wish there is a pump with it, but it‚Äôs great to take it with you on trips. "
59,59337,2023-06-28,,Great lotion with good smell. The package size is quite big.
60,59337,2023-05-01,,I love Desert Essence brand.  This has a nice clean scent and is very moisturizing. 
61,59337,2023-04-23,,Smells natural and not artificial.   Non-greasy feel.  Better than more expensive brands.
62,59337,2023-03-14,,I bought several of these in different fragrances and like them all
63,59337,2023-03-10,Excellent! Perfect feel and moisturization,"I love the feel and level of moisture of this lemon lotion. Plus, the ingredients are healthful and very ideal-free of suspicious ingredients. "
64,59337,2023-01-05,,"Great product, I will definitely buy it again when I need it"
65,59337,2022-11-27,,Great cream with fresh scent. Texture is pleasant. I use it both for the hands and body.
66,59337,2022-10-28,ÏµúÍ≥†!,"How good it is that there are such products for iherb, I put 10\10 to him."
67,59337,2022-08-05,,I have been wanting to try this particular scent of this lotion forever; it seems like its being phased out or just not being carried in Canada for some reason. It smells very nice! 
68,59337,2022-07-26,,"After using the lavender lotion of the desert essence. I decided to try the lemon scent. And it smells great. And just like the lavender, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Love it!"
69,59337,2022-03-20,,The scent of lemon in this lotion is terrific. It isnt overpowering and it feels good on skin as a moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this lotion doesnt irritate.
70,59337,2023-07-17,,"Makes my skin smooth and smooth, the smell lasts more"
71,59337,2023-04-25,,"Effective body moisturiser, perfume is fresh and plant but strong. "
72,59337,2022-02-20,Nice smell,"I am a big fan of lemon scent so I really liked the smell of this lotion. However for my skin it wasn‚Äôt good, i noticed that after applying lotion - after some time my skin was getting itchy, not sure why. Guess that‚Äôs individual reaction of my skin so cant blame the product."
73,59337,2021-08-23,Excellent for dry skin,"I decided to try another smell of Desert Essence lotion and lemon was great decision! The smell is like real lemin, not artificial chemical one. Good for dry skin, after using it you can feel lemon for a couple of hours. Not too thick, absorbs quickly, vegan. And colorful tube always cheers me up! "
74,59337,2016-11-01,Lovely refreshing lemon smell!,"Love the smell of this, it smells very natural and isn't overwhelming. I work in healthcare and have to wash my hands frequently, they can get really dry.  I've tried a lot of hand creams, while other hand creams feel watery and do little for my hands, the Desert Essence hand and body lotion absorbs really well into my skin and I'm left with lovely soft hands. This and the Desert Essence Sweet Almond lotion are my favourite. I will keep using this and will re-order when I run out."
75,59337,2015-06-03,"Great Lotion, Lighter Scent than other Dessert Essence","I love Desert Essence lotions, but most of the varieties are made with either Japanese honeysuckle extract or too heavily scented for my nose.  The Italian Lemon has no JHE and contains a 100% essential oil-based scent.  It smells lovely as you rub it in, but it's not something I smell on my skin all day long.  The lotion itself is fantastic - very moisturizing, but not heavy on the skin."
76,59337,2021-02-27,Just buy it!,"I love this lotion. The density/thickness is just right, not too liquid and not heavy. And the smell is amazing! Not like fake chemical lemon candy, but real lemons. Maybe just a little bit sticky (perfect for body, but I wipe my hands before touching my phone). Will purchase again. "
77,59337,2018-09-21,"Lively, citrus-scented body lotion. ","My hunt for the perfect lotion is over! I've tried many different brands of natural, non-toxic lotions and this one is hands down my favorite so far. The lotion is rich but not too greasy, it provides skin with necessary moisture. Absorbs quickly, without oily residue. Leaves skin smooth and nourished and really moisturizes my dry skin especially during the winter months. I loved the fresh lemon smell when I'm applying it but I also love the fact that the scent is mild and does not linger. The tube is convenient to pack or throw in my gym bag, which is another plus compared to lotions with pumps. I also sometimes order the unscented one, but this is a great fresh scent for summer.  "
78,59337,2023-07-29,the smell was not great ,I usually love lemon smell but this didn't do it for me it was too sweet 
79,59337,2022-09-19,"Great Scent, Tacky Feel ","It's a beautiful lemon scent but it does feel pretty tacky on the skin. If you sleep without the air-conditioner switched on and live in a tropical climate like I do, it could get uncomfortable. "
80,59337,2021-03-29,Wonderfully Creamy,"This feels like a high quality ingredient filled cream not lotion because lotion has a bit more water. Leaves my hands with a silky overlayer. The lemon fragrance is very nice but like most fragrances dissipates within minutes... but while it lasts it's  dreamy.
I wish they made this in a 4oz purse size."
81,59337,2022-01-16,Smells nice,Not too greasy and it smells great.  The lemon isn't overwhelming and it fades fast.  
82,59337,2021-12-26,Sweet Lemon,I only wish this came in a large pump container. Love the fragrance and the deep emollients in this lotion.
83,59337,2021-12-04,,This brand has a range of great creams at reasonable prices. Tried this as rose was out of stock - smells great 
84,59337,2021-10-28,,"this is my first time try lime variant.
usually i buy coconut variant.
"
85,59337,2021-01-25,,Great moisturizer for my dry skin! I like that it gets soaked in completely without any residue. The smell is quite strong while applying but gets better in a minute.
86,59337,2020-10-05,üçãLove It,"I bought the ‚ÄòItalian Lemon‚Äô type of lotion and I‚Äôm impressed from this item.üçã
It moisturise the skin very well and leave it with a lemony and citrusy smell  that stay on the skin for a long time!
"
87,59337,2021-10-31,,nice thick lotion that has a nice lemon cookie smell .
88,59337,2023-09-20,,I didn‚Äôt like it and it‚Äôs smells bad 
89,59337,2021-09-21,,"Great smell, a very light cream, absorbs well., but not heavy enough for over dry hands.  Smell does not linger very long which is a bit disappointing.   But overall a good cream."
90,59337,2021-08-27,It‚Äôs okay,"Great texture, light yet stays on the skin all the day like you had just put it on. 4 stars just because i did not like the scent very much, other then that it is really good!"
91,59337,2021-07-05,Perfect for summer,"Good cream with a pleasant refreshing smell - fits perfectly for summertime. A little bit dense, not so easy to apply. Next time I would like to try other types of Desert Essence, too."
92,59337,2020-12-13,Excellent lotion,"We use it like hand lotion. Very nice smell of lemon, well absorbed without any stickiness after, superb!"
93,59337,2019-08-20,Really fresh lemon smell,"Lovely moisturisor, not greasy, the smell is so clean and like the juice and peel of a real lemon."

102,59337,2021-09-05,„Åæ„ÅÇËâØ„ÅÑ,"Lemons. It's just lemon. It's so lemony that I don't care how it feels. It's just a natural scent, so it's great. It's a refreshing cream, and it's good for mid-summer."
103,59337,2021-04-07,◊ê◊ô◊©◊ï◊®,"I hoped for stronger smell of lemon, but it‚Äôs very mild. Using it as a hand cream. It‚Äôs nice but don‚Äôt last long. The hands are soft but it feels still dry."
104,59337,2021-09-10,,The citrus smell of lemon is refreshing! The texture of the cream is rich and yet not oily.  Keeps the skin moisturised .

106,59337,2020-05-12,Addicted to lemon,My dad is addicted to lemon lotion and soap. He this product. 
107,59337,2020-01-15,Nice lotion. Will buy again,"I like the smell very much. When it is absorbed it is also very pleasant on skin, it just takes some time to absorb."
108,59337,2019-06-17,Dries out my skin.,"Juicy delicious lemon scent. But this is so extremely drying to my skin, it makes it drier than using no lotion at all and leaves a strange tacky dry feeling residue. I ended up using it as a cleanser. Its actually more drying to my skin than most of my foaming cleansers and I always need tons of lotion afterward."
109,59337,2022-07-01,,"Perfect scent
Big size
Good package"
110,59337,2022-09-25,,This lotion has a bad smell mixed with the lemon scent.

"
143,59337,2024-06-03,The refreshing scent is soothing,"I use it after bathing to prevent my family's skin from drying out. Lemon has a very refreshing scent, so it not only refreshes the mood after bathing, but also calms the mind. I don't think there are any Japanese people who dislike the scent of lemon, so I can recommend it to anyone."
144,59337,2024-10-10,It smells good,"This is a must-have product for the transitional season like now. It doesn't have a very strong scent, but the lemon scent is strong and makes me feel good, and it spreads well when I apply it.

The ingredients used are very good, such as aloe, jojoba oil, shea butter, coconut oil, etc. Of course, it contains lemon peel oil and is vegan and gluten-free, which has not been tested on animals. The Italian lemon of Desert Essence seems to be delicious on the skin from the naming."

I was a little worried about this and left it alone, but when I tried using it again, I realized that it is quite useful as a hand cream. It's not very moisturizing, but it absorbs quickly and isn't sticky. During the daytime, when you have to reapply it many times, the feeling of use is more important than moisturizing.

219,59337,2023-03-05,,"It feels a little milder than a freshly cut lemon scent. The cream spreads just right, probably because it contains shea butter and jojoba oil. It gives a smooth finish, so it may not be suitable for those who want a strong moisturizing effect. Anyway, it's a large capacity, so it's going to be a season. I would love to try other scents."

257,59337,2022-10-03,,"This is the second time I use the dessert essence cream, but I like it because it has a large capacity, has a good texture, and is good value for money. The scent of this lemon is very good to wake you up when you use it in the morning. I will repeat when it is gone."
258,59337,2022-09-27,,I have been using this brand shampoo and body lotion for several years since I started using iHerb. The body lotion has a good scent and has a light and soft texture. It is a good composition to choose the scent I want according to my mood. there is no
259,59337,2022-03-04,Fresh scent,"It has a strong lemon scent. It has a strong scent, but it does not have an artificial feel, but rather a freshly squeezed lemon. I personally liked the feeling of use. It is not very sticky and fits your skin smoothly and quickly. In addition, I think that it has a large capacity and is excellent in terms of cost performance."
260,59337,2022-02-27,,"This bright citrus-scented body lotion refreshes and energizes while nourishing the skin. Desert Essence Lemon from Italy Body and Hand Lotion contains Shea Butter, Sunflower Seed Oil and Jojoba Seed Oil which are quickly absorbed into the skin leaving it smooth and silky. Lemon Peel Oil leaves a light, delicious scent."
261,59337,2022-01-16,,"You can refresh yourself with a very refreshing scent! The cream isn't too soft, so it's a good idea to leave it alone and not harden at the tip of the tube. It's not sticky even after it's applied, and it has a nice scent, so I'll repeat it."
262,59337,2022-01-06,,"This is Love! I ordered lotions from this company with different scents, I liked everything. They moisturize and nourish my skin very well even in winter, my skin is of a normal type, perhaps very dry atopic skin is not suitable. Although when I started allergic to cold on my hands, only desert essence saved me from all the creams, quickly removed the redness and soothed the skin."
263,59337,2021-12-29,,"I love this brand of shampoo, so I decided to try a body lotion. The aroma is incredible! Fresh, juicy lemon, up to saliva) It feels very nice on the skin, absorbs well, does not leave a film, moisturizes well and leaves an unobtrusive aroma of lemon. For problem dry skin may not be suitable - really light, but for my combo - great."
264,59337,2021-12-05,,"It was this fragrance that I ordered for the first time, but I have already tried almond and coconut from this brand. I really like that all creams have a pleasant, but not stifling, natural aroma! Well moisturize and nourish the skin, are quickly absorbed. The texture of the cream is thick, ideal for dry skin and winter. No allergic reactions were noticed. The packaging is decent, large volume, a protective membrane under the lid. The smell of freshly cut lemon. A fragrance that gives freshness in the heat of summer and invigorates on a cold winter day."

270,59337,2023-10-24,,It has excellent moisturizing power.
271,59337,2023-10-05,,"It's not very good or bad, but it's a brand I like and it's easy to use on my desk, so I think I'll keep using it while changing the scent. It doesn't feel immediately moisturizing, but it feels like a light coating."
272,59337,2022-09-04,,"Wow, seriously, wow, we can smell the smell. Of course, the smell of lemon comes out, but it gives you a feeling of comfort, and as a moisturizer, it also makes the hydration crazy and makes the hand feel awesome."
273,59337,2022-06-11,,"The moisturizing effect is refreshing, but the scent is just wonderful, and the fresh feeling of freshly cut lemon is irresistible. The scent disappears immediately."

288,59337,2023-03-16,Good overall,"Maybe I was expecting too much juiciness for the scent, or I like citrus fruits, so compared to lemon scents from various manufacturers, I felt like it smelled like lemon. Once rubbed into the skin, the lemony feeling disappears. I use it all over my body. With this size, you can definitely use it for more than half a year. I plan to use it all year round. The spread is not bad, and since it contains various types of vegetable oils and shea butter, it does not feel sticky and protects. It also has moisturizing power."

291,59337,2023-03-07,can't absorb,"The quality doesn't seem to fit the purpose. It doesn't absorb well into the skin, so I have to rub it for a while, so it doesn't feel uncomfortable or smooth. It has a mild lemon scent and I bought it to use as a body lotion, but it is quite large."

300,59337,2022-07-12,,"I bought this product with the full expectation of the scent, but it's not as refreshing as I thought it would be... The lotion itself smells like lemona, which is good, but when I apply it on my body, it smells a little sour; The scent dissipates quickly, but if you're expecting a scent like Aqua DiPharma's Myrto, you're likely to regret it. The applicability is moderate, and it is satisfactory because it is not very sticky and has good moisturizing power. I think it will be good to use in summer. The capacity is also large compared to the price, so it seems to be a good product for the price."
301,59337,2024-09-19,good,Body lotion with a refreshing lemon scent but a light scent compared to mango and almond.
302,59337,2024-04-29,This is the worst lotion I've ever bought.,"I think the smell is so bad. The smell itself isn't that bad, but it's even too strong."

311,59337,2023-03-24,good smell,It's not sticky and it's great for someone who likes citrus scents.
312,59337,2023-03-21,,"I'm worried about the smell of degraded oil, but the texture is easy to use and spreads well."
313,59337,2023-02-02,,There are plenty! One season will make up for it. It has a fresh lemon scent and is not sweet. I like it.
314,59337,2023-01-29,Smell is a matter of personal taste!,"The product is good, but the scent is not good."

317,59337,2022-11-16,,"The aroma is a very fresh lemon scent, very refreshing after use"
318,59337,2021-04-29,Natural fresh lemon scent and great value for money,"I love it so much that I don't know how many times I've bought it again. It has a refreshing texture, so it's suitable for dry skin from spring to summer. In winter, I think you need a thick cream or oil on top. The scent is truly lemony, and it lifts your mood. There is no strange artificial scent, so I think it can be used by people of all ages and genders. I have sensitive skin, but I didn't get any rashes or tightness even during hay fever season or when the seasons change. It works well in any season, both in terms of moisturizing and aromatherapy. If you apply it under your armpits after a bath, it can also be used as a simple deodorant! It's a tube type that stands on its own, and the lid opens with a 1-click, so it's easy to use, takes up less space than pump-type products, and is easy to use and throw away."
319,59337,2021-01-27,,"The lotion is more like a thick cream that works perfectly for dry skin. I save myself for them in winter. Despite its density, it is well absorbed. The aroma is very pleasant. I rub them on both hands and body. It copes with the task of moisturizing with a bang."
320,59337,2020-11-03,Favorite cream,"Natural composition. The dough is quite dense and thick. Just what I'm looking for in a cream. The smell is pleasant, unobtrusive. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. Once absorbed, the skin feels moisturized for a long time without the discomfort of film, stickiness or grease. Does not tighten. The skin looks nourished and hydrated. Feels super soft Fit perfectly without causing breakouts or clogged pores."
321,59337,2020-10-16,The perfect lotion of your favorite brand,"Great body lotion! I also tried coconut, almond, lime lotions with this brand, and mango lotions are also waiting for their turn. In my opinion, they are all similar in quality, they differ fundamentally only in smells. Coconut is of course brighter, and the smell on the skin stays longer, but this lemon smell is pleasant, not harsh, refreshing! The composition is very good, and according to the results it suits me - the skin after it is soft, moisturized, nourished. It is not too thick in consistency, it spreads well over the body, leaves no traces and is absorbed quickly enough, there is no feeling of a film on the skin. I usually use it in the evening after a shower, and the skin in the morning is soft and tender."
322,59337,2018-04-18,Excellent!,"I love the creams of this brand. At application completely all over again are not absorbed - give white strips. But I found a solution - after applying, I go again through the white strips and the cream is perfectly absorbed. After 5 minutes you can dress, the feeling of film on your body is gone. I put it in the morning and everything is fine! The smell is pleasant - straight lemon-lemon!"
323,59337,2022-04-02,,Desert Essence is a lot of fun to use. It is also helpful to have a large amount. I'm glad that the scent is too strong.
324,59337,2022-03-29,refreshing~,"I love sweet scents in winter, but when it gets warmer, I feel awkward, so I was looking for a refreshing body care. Lemon is perfect for the coming season! It's refreshing and feels good to use!"
325,59337,2021-12-27,,"I bought it to apply it to dry body in winter, but I bought it because it is easy to carry.. It has a mild lemon scent, so there is no objection. It's a bit damp, so it's good to mix it with oil."
326,59337,2021-10-21,,"The moment you put it on, it has a refreshing scent of lemon, but it doesn't leave a good scent on your skin. The texture is not hard and moist, so it looks good in the dry season."
327,59337,2022-04-24,,"A strong smell, I liked it... The quality is medium. Not all of this is much better than it for the same price, for example Palmer.. The size is large, like Bath and Body Work cream...."
328,59337,2021-09-29,The cream is great!,"I constantly buy creams from this company. Excellent composition, pleasant texture, easily absorbed and moisturized by the skin. This cream also has a wonderful aroma - bright, summer and delicate at the same time. As with all natural remedies, the aroma disappears rather quickly, but still a little remains, and it is so pleasant on a cold autumn day, entering a warm room to catch the barely audible, but such a summer, cozy aroma of Italian lemon."
329,59337,2021-09-19,"I love this lotion very much, the best budget one.","An excellent body cream, this is not the first time I have taken it. The volume is good, enough for a long time. Natural composition - it contains jojoba oil, coconut oil, shea butter, etc., it moisturizes the skin well, while not leaving an oily sheen on the skin. DOES NOT CONTAIN: SLS, parabens, phthalates, artificial flavors, colorants, silicones, petroleum products. Well absorbed. The line also has a large assortment of flavors - lemon, coconut, mango, grapes, without perfume (for every taste). I try everything gradually. Recommend)))"
330,59337,2021-09-05,Refreshing scent,"The refreshing scent of lemon that suits the warm season is good. In such a refreshing scent, I think it is moist to use. I want to use something with a refreshing scent in spring and summer, but I'm happy because products for spring and summer tend to dry out. It's a pity that the scent doesn't remain, but I don't mind using it as a hand cream instead."
331,59337,2021-09-01,,"This is now my favorite scent of the brand's entire line of lotions. He is divine. I never thought that the smell of lemon could please me so much. And, as always, it perfectly moisturizes and nourishes the skin of the body (it‚Äôs better I haven‚Äôt tried it in my entire life yet)."
332,59337,2021-06-12,Funky Lemon Smell,"The cream, unexpectedly, really liked it! Let's start with what I took for my hands, but a large package - 150 ml - allows you to use it for the body as well. Further, what immediately ""catches the eye"", or rather, in the nose)) - a wonderful natural scent of lemon! The times with lemon are different and many of them give off chymosis. There is also a very subtle and delicate lemon aroma, the feeling that you are smelling a lemon just plucked from a cable car! Or eat lemon cake)) Then we apply it to the skin and ... again, a pleasant surprise! Delicate dense texture, easy to apply, perfectly distributed, absorbed without leaving traces of grease. At the same time, it perfectly moisturizes and nourishes the skin. The feeling of well-groomed skin lasts for a long time. I will definitely order this cream again or as a gift and want to try other creams from this company!"
333,59337,2021-01-25,,"Excellent result, I apply without the help of others besides the family. It will come in handy with the target of absolutely absolutely everyone except for the small ones except for the elders, I order not at all the first only one time, besides, I am satisfied with the quality of the food. The result came in addition to the lack of damage, the children really like it this way, as well as me. Thanks for your interest !!"
334,59337,2017-02-04,The lemon! It is! It is!,"It is not really any smell except lemon. I smell the lemon itself. The smell does not last long, it becomes smooth after painting. I was surprised by the sense of size more than anything. With this size, this price is less for Japan, I guess it is a little ,,, It is very good as I use it with a large number of people."
335,59337,2016-05-26,good..,"It used to be a mans home before, but this time I used the lemon fragrance for the first time. The mango had a sweet aroma, but it was so thick that there was a good feeling for the other person. However, I like the fresh lemon flavor that is not too much for this product. First, I use it because of its ingredients. I do not have any bad chemistry ... so I'm not really good at rubbing, but if I rub it well, it gets absorbed and moistened. The only bad thing is that when I use almost all of the products, it is tubular, so I wrangle the product container by hand, and it was so bad that the product container coating was wiped away. I would like to change the product container."
336,59337,2023-10-20,General use,The texture is thicker. The taste is pretty good and the price is reasonable.
337,59337,2023-10-16,Honest lemon scent,"It's not citrus, but a lemon scent that isn't really sweet. It feels like it's being sterilized."
338,59337,2023-09-29,usually,The moisturizing power and scent were normal. It may not be very effective if it is too dry.
339,59337,2023-08-19,,"It doesn't feel too sticky, but I felt it was a little unsatisfactory to use as a hand cream."
340,59337,2023-07-19,,"It smells like sweet lemon. It's hard to stretch until it becomes transparent, but I like it because it makes my skin firmer."
341,59337,2023-06-09,,"It's okay. After applying it, my skin doesn't feel so soft, so I can't touch it. What a scent."
342,59337,2023-02-25,hmm,Is it an exaggeration to say that freshly cut lemons have a disturbing scent mixed in?
343,59337,2022-10-21,,"I have just started it, I will come back to modify my comment after several uses"
344,59337,2021-12-31,odor,"I was looking forward to it because I like the citrus scent ... Something stinks ... The scent of lemon spreads the moment I apply it, and it's good at that time ... It smells when I smell my hands. It smells more after a while. I can't say anything, it smells like it's not clean. I asked a few friends to apply it, but it was divided into half who felt it smelled and half who didn't mind it. It's a shame because it's very comfortable to apply."
345,59337,2021-10-25,,"I didn't accept the scent. Since it's a lemon, I thought it wouldn't be lost that much, but I think it's a bad word, but it smells like saliva in addition to lemon. All of Sabon's hand creams have a residual scent that feels like saliva, so it may be the scent of some ingredient. I was in trouble because it has a large capacity."
346,59337,2023-03-31,,Quality incense packaging size good age
347,59337,2023-02-15,,I love the smell and I love the texture
348,59337,2022-09-03,,"I like oral care products from this brand and have used several of them. This is my first purchase of body care products. When you apply it to your hand, it spreads smoothly and is moisturizing without stickiness."
349,59337,2022-04-24,,"The first scent is very good. After a while, the scent becomes more bitter. It smells a little strong. I think it would be nice to smell about half of it. It's comfortable to use, but it's a waste. Just right when mixed with unscented ones."
350,59337,2021-06-13,,"Recommended for those who like citrus scents. It is a slightly firm texture. I use it for hand cream, but since it has a large capacity, it can be used generously. Since it comes with a film, it will not come out during transportation. I want to try other scents, but it doesn't go away."
351,59337,2021-05-20,Heavy cream,"Moisturizing is normal. It was summer, so I searched for a light cream and citrus scent, but it was rather heavy. I think a small amount is enough. The scent is refreshing"
352,59337,2021-05-03,,"The scent is the scent of lemon itself rather than a good scent. It has a refreshing scent. The feeling of painting is also refreshing than moist. It doesn't seem to have much moisturizing effect. It is a little unsatisfactory to use for the purpose of moisturizing in winter, so I will use it in summer."
353,59337,2021-03-07,excellent! Very pleasant and emollient,The cream contains natural nutrients that make my skin. Mostly my very dry hand skin in winter is as soft as silk. It is very pleasant and seems to become a fixture within my skincare products. Like is welcome if you like (:
354,59337,2021-02-14,,"I love fresh aromas very much! Very economical consumption, I use it for hands and body. Even in cold weather, the skin does not dry out. I recommend!"
355,59337,2021-01-29,Favorite scent,"I use it on my body after taking a bath. It's a cream rather than a lotion, and it's a fairly hard cream, so it takes a lot of power when you take it out of the tube. Once you take it out of the tube and put it on your skin, it stretches well and the refreshing scent of lemon is pleasant. .. .. I wonder if it will be easier to put out in the warm season. I'd like to repeat it because it has a lot of capacity and moisturizing power, but I'm worried that this hard cream can be put out to the end with my powerlessness w"
356,59337,2020-12-24,Lemon,"It's a real steamed lemon scent lotion. The moisturizing power seems average, but the scent is so good!! It‚Äôs refreshing and light, so I feel good"
357,59337,2017-04-19,Rather than thinking ...,"It is not fragrant. I thought of a refreshing lemon essential oil incense, but it does not seem strong, but it does not seem to be refreshing. It's okay. It's not a thin lotion that absorbs immediately. However, it is absorbed immediately because I question the door a few times. The capacity is big to carry."
358,59337,2017-01-11,You are my favorite sniper ..,"The fragrance is full of fresh lemon fragrance! I do not know if I'm wearing it right away and I'm wearing it right away. The end of the game, right? I do not have to compare it to the others!"
359,59337,2021-05-05,I like the scent,"I chose it because it is an organic product. The scent is also gentle and satisfying. However, it was a pity that the size of the tube was large and it was not suitable for carrying when going out. I compared it with the size and tuna cans!"
360,59337,2022-07-10,,smells very good. for the whole body. very tender. I will order again.
361,59337,2022-07-05,,"The quality is beautiful, the quantity is fair, the packaging is reliable, the benefit notes"

364,59337,2022-02-13,,"Very cool cream, moisturizes well, smells very cool of lemon. Very pleasant. Very pleasantly surprised by this cream"
365,59337,2022-02-12,,Very good shopping site The product is of good quality and the shipping is fast and the overall feeling is good
366,59337,2022-01-17,,"Nice lotion. Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Pleasant aroma, but as often happens with Desert Essence, has little to do with the aroma of lemon."
367,59337,2022-01-09,,A dense consistency just right for the cold season. The delicate scent of lemon cheers you up. I will buy more.
368,59337,2022-01-02,,"Awesome cream !! Hands from frequent washing were like sandpaper. For a week of using the cream, the hands have changed! I definitely recommend it."
369,59337,2021-12-21,,Very satisfied with the cheap price and good stuff. The family likes it is worth repurchasing but the packaging is simple
370,59337,2021-12-17,Sweet and sweet smell,"I don't want to ask for it, just for the sake of change"
371,59337,2021-12-17,,"The smell is magical, I'm just a fanatic of lemon)) The skin is then soft, nourished velvety. Full delight))"
372,59337,2021-12-14,,"Cool cream for the winter, smell like a real lemon, thick consistency for dry skin is excellent"
373,59337,2015-04-11,foolish sour smell,"Of course the main thing - a clear structure, simple, natural ingredients. It does its job well. the only thing - the smell is not liked. despite the fact that I love lemons .. cream smells sour, unpleasant, but not disgusting :) conclusion: I will take the cream with a different scent (vanilla, for example, excellent)"
374,59337,2023-04-02,Good,Lemon scent is fresh and good
375,59337,2021-08-13,Very like!,"This is not the first time I have taken these lotions. They smell very, very tasty!) Tried: lemon, mango, almonds. I like everyone in their own way."
376,59337,2021-08-10,,"This line of lotions is my favorite. Unfortunately, they cut it down. Perfectly absorbs and moisturizes. The aroma of lemon is quite bright, with a pronounced sourness, but, like other lotions, it quickly disappears."
377,59337,2021-06-29,,"A scent that suits the heat of midsummer! I feel refreshed! For now, I'm trying all the incense in this series one by one!"
378,59337,2021-06-10,"A very pleasant, rich lotion","Lotion with a pleasant and rather intense lemon scent. The consistency is very pleasant, there is a feeling of moisture after it. But at the same time it is absorbed quite quickly."
379,59337,2021-05-17,,"Great scent, great skin care. Only use them on the upper body, too good for the rest of the body, if I wouldn't smell anything ..."
380,59337,2021-04-26,,The scent is slightly strong. I think there will be likes and dislikes because of this scent. We also recommend lavender and fragrance-free. The application and moisturizing properties are better than expected.
381,59337,2021-03-30,Suitable for the winter.,"The lotion smells very nice with a fresh lemon scent. The texture is quite greasy, it is not absorbed too quickly. Isn't cold winter weather suitable, when the skin dries from the radiators."
382,59337,2020-12-24,It smells good,"When you get tired of the sweet scent, use this in rotation. The scent is clean and uncomplicated citrus. The container is solid and the texture is rather firm, so it is difficult to put it out when it gets smaller."
383,59337,2020-12-11,,Very good body cream. I have been using it for several years. Good composition even if it is not organic. No harmful additives. Pleasant texture. Very good smell of Lemon.
384,59337,2020-10-21,,"Smell of lemon pie: pleasant, a little tired only towards the end of the tube. The lotion looks more like a cream, gives tangible hydration"
385,59337,2020-08-23,It feels good,"I was shocked when the Kneipp lemon body cream was my favorite, but it was discontinued and it was very shocking. It has a nice lemony feel and is used for bathing."
386,59337,2017-04-30,The fragrance is perfect for the summer.,"Although there is an extension, it may not be suitable for those who prefer lightness as it is close to cream.
I'd like to use the latex type in summer, but since the fragrance is refreshing I think I will use it in May."
387,59337,2016-08-26,The incense is fresh and a little sweet.,"If you write like the others, the coating is peeled off and buried in your hands. The fragrance is so refreshing that it is good to use in the summer, and it is a little bit sharper."
388,59337,2016-05-15,The fragrance is fine.,"Sour Lemon Scent - I'm not particularly impressed, but I like it. This brand hand cream is peeled off from the shell when it is used for a long time, and it is used after coating it with a large transparent box tape."
389,59337,2016-05-03,There is no sustainability of lemon,"Toward the coming season, buy it for fragrance to be scared. When attached it is perfectly smell of lemon as it is, but it is not sustainable. I think that it will moisturize, but I will make it petty for a while."
390,59337,2015-10-31,I love!,I've tried several creams body of this brand and the truth moment I'll stick with this. It smells great (lemon sorbet) and moisturizes enough but have very dry skin. Repetire insurance.

392,59337,2022-06-12,Refreshing!,"I like the refreshing citrus scent, so I like it. It spreads well and keeps your skin moisturized."
393,59337,2022-06-08,,"It's refreshing, but it's moisturized properly, but the scent of lemon is strong and synthetic-like women should be pros and cons"
394,59337,2022-03-18,,It is a gentle product that does not hesitate to apply.
395,59337,2021-12-01,"It's a good lemon, XD","Corruption test is the same (because of rough use), there is a little oil, but I accept it, a normal cream"
396,59337,2021-05-04,,"The texture as a body cream is very good, but it's a little disappointing because it doesn't smell like lemon more than I imagined. I think it would be even better if it had a refreshing lemon scent like the shampoo of the same brand."
397,59337,2021-02-01,Good,"Hydrates well. The lemon smell is not strong and disappears as soon as the cream dries. If you are looking for a cream that smells good, coconut would be better. Dries in seconds."
398,59337,2020-12-13,,"Not a bad lotion, but it has a pungent smell immediately after application, then the smell decreases. I didn't really like the consistency. I didn‚Äôt want to buy it, but I won‚Äôt scold the second time"
399,59337,2020-11-16,,"The smell of real lemon. The cream is quite well absorbed, the texture is less oily ""tropical coconut"" and ""coconut"". Still my favorite is the ""tropical coconut""."
400,59337,2020-04-25,Medium,"The quality of the cream itself I liked, say, so standard. But, as it turned out, the aroma is not mine, the lemon is too intense for me."
401,59337,2019-06-04,Sarasara,It is easy to use because it is not sticky and its aroma is not sticky. The size is American. It can not be for portable use.
402,59337,2021-07-03,Italian lemon scent ‚ô°,"This is my favorite scent. Perfect for this season ‚ô´ Large capacity and generous use. At this price, I think it has high moisturizing power."
403,59337,2021-08-08,,"I bought this because the lavender was out of stock. At the beginning, the refreshing scent of lemon and the slightly artificial scent are felt at the end, so there are four stars. I use it all over my body after a daily shower. The texture is smooth, so I always have it for daily care."
404,59337,2021-05-21,Best!,"The mango flavor here is too thick, so I bought one for summer. It's sweet and sour. ------------------------------------ ------------------------ +Sujeong) I usually like sweet scents, so I can't get used to the tangy lemon scent.. The moisturizing power is not good. Use it for summer."
405,59337,2021-04-30,The smell is subtle,"Behind the scent of fresh lemon, there is a scent of something lurking ... I don't really like it, so there is no repeat."
