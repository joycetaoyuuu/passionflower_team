0,111126,2024-06-07,Amazing product for sleep,"I came to this brand - Banyan - a few months ago, as I was taking their Healthy Hair, which has helped me a lot. I Sleep Soundly is also amazing and impressive product. I take it only on evenings when I´m nervous or stressed and it helps me calm down and slow my thoughts  so that I can sleep more deeply and soundly. I like it´s herbal composition. Pure quality as well."
1,111126,2024-05-13,,My mom had sleep problems for a while and I tried to find a natural alternative to help her sleep. It made a huge difference. Getting it second time!
2,111126,2024-06-17,The results are in!,"This product delivers what it says, sleep soundly! Difficulty to calm down often occurs with a stressful day, and I Sleep Soundly smooths out the emotions for a restful sleep!"
3,111126,2024-04-08,Clean and good sleep aid!,Clean and good sleep aid with Ayurvedic herbs! l LOVE THE BRAND BANYAN BOTANICALS. Helps me relax and sleep deep! I love this product! If it wasn't so expensive I would buy it always!
4,111126,2024-03-02,,"I’ve tried many sleep supplements but this one is my go to! I find it helps to rotate them for effectiveness, but this is the one I take most often."
5,111126,2023-11-01,Contradictory feelings,"Actually I like Natural factors betters because even one pill helped me. As for these ones, I take 2 pills as recommended and I can't say I fall asleep immediately but al least I don't wake up throughout the night. "
6,111126,2024-09-07,Worth trying,There are lots of good reviews but this did not help me with my sleep. I know it works for lots of people so it is worth trying
7,111126,2023-11-13,Not sure about these,I love this brand and maybe wishing to sleep better during menopause is a tall order but this hasn’t helped me at all - yet. I will continue but for me the teas just before bed are better. 
8,111126,2023-03-13,Excellent! ,"The name really fits! I have used many herbal sleep supplements, and Banyan I Sleep Soundly is the best one I have found.  The ingredients are safe; excellent quality. I prefer a sleep supplement that doesn't contain melatonin (so I don't disturb my body's own melatonin production), and this supplement fits that criterion.  Easy-to-take size."
9,111126,2024-08-09,Quality ingredients ,"Great sleep after taking this, stopped waking up in the middle of the night "
10,111126,2023-04-23,,I use this interchangely with lemon balm as a sleep aid (cycle every few months). Quality seems good as I use only 1 pill instead of the recommended dosage (with magnesium glycinate) each night. It's pretty strong herby taste but not overwhelming. 
11,111126,2023-03-18,,"I like the ingredients of this preparation, although it doesn’t always overcome my sleeplessness.   Most of the time I take 2 tablets, and it seems to work pretty fast.  But for me, sometimes it seems nothing is going to stop my brain. Guess it depends on what other things (like certain B vitamins) are at play. "
12,111126,2024-02-28,Kept me awake,"Not only did it not work at all, it tasted terrible.  The consistency of this product is not user friendly. And too large.  Waste of my money.
"
13,111126,2022-05-16,,"These pills have been amazing in my quest for sleep! They are all natural and do not leave me feeling groggy the next day. Not only do I fall asleep more easily, I stay asleep! This is the best price I have seen for these and iHerb had them in stock when they were sold out everywhere else. Highly recommend Banyan and iHerb!"
14,111126,2023-08-10,"good quality, gentle medicine","Somewhat helpful in getting back to sleep when I wake in the middle of night, but quite 'gentle'. Will be great if you have very milld insomnia. Energetically, I can feel it's an excellent quality product, just not quite strong enough for me."
15,111126,2022-04-23,Good to have in your insomnia collection,"This product has a somewhat different ingredient list to many of the other sleep formulas so if you have become used to the others, and they have stopped working, this is a good alternative. It works as well as my other most used sleep potions. Which is to say - I still don't sleep through but I sleep better than if I didn't take it. Quite expensive though."
16,111126,2022-09-02,,"my first time use of this product, I rate it as effective, really helps falls asleep better and remain asleep longer.  i take 2 depends on the necessity... overall, quite effective "
17,111126,2023-07-14,Works for me,"This was a really good choice. More expensive than other sleep supplements, but worth it."
