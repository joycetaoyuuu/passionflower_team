0,129090,2024-08-05,Great Product,Thought I'd give this a try as I have problems relaxing and falling asleep plus getting back to sleep.  I take 1 pill and it does seem to help me relax and fall asleep. it help me to fall back to sleep after waking up during the night too. it's an easy to swallow capsule and you take only 1. A great natural alternative to other sleeping aids.
1,129090,2024-01-24,Passion flower ,"Great quality, great ingredients, great supplement! It makes you have a deep sleep and it’s supposed to help with hormones (ladies) lol. we need all the help we can get! Get some and try it, to see what you think. Great benefit to our diet/improvements make a difference! "
2,129090,2024-08-26,helps with menopausal symptoms,"I purchased this product because I suffer from menopausal symptoms, and I have to say, Passion Flower Extract has been a game-changer for me. It has significantly alleviated my nervousness, depression, and sleep disturbances. Whenever I feel overwhelmed or stressed, Passion Flower Extract helps to calm me down and provides much-needed support.

One of the things I appreciate most about this product is how easy the pills are to swallow. The dosage is perfect, making it simple to incorporate into my daily routine. The price-performance ratio is excellent, and the quality of the ingredients is top-notch.

I’ve tried several Passion Flower Extract products in the past, including those with multiple ingredients. However, I found that those didn’t work as effectively for me. Pure Passion Flower Extract in a high dose seems to be the best solution for my needs. I also appreciate that this product doesn’t seem to have any interactions, unlike some other supplements I’ve tried.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product. It has made a noticeable difference in my well-being, and I feel more balanced and at ease. I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with similar issues. The combination of effectiveness, ease of use, and value for money makes it a standout choice."
3,129090,2024-09-23,For relaxation,"I've been using this product for ten days, but from the first capsule you can feel that after half an hour the tension and anxiety decrease, and the effect lasts for quite a long time. I usually take it first thing in the morning to make it easier to bear the hectic pace at work. Good quality and dosage that is a bit stronger but without side effects. I recommend!"
4,129090,2024-09-15,,"My most favorite herbal, nothing like it in the whole world! It works like a sedative. Fabulous for those really stressful days. If relaxation is what you want then this is the herb for you. Small price to pay to get relaxed. It can also be used for sleep, the quality of sleep with no groggy feeling is amazing! Not to mention,  non addictive! "
5,129090,2024-09-03,Great Product,"Taste is okay, ingredient’s are pretty true to package, size is about right. Using it for brain and bodybuilding/muscle building, benefits are immaculate for dieting as well. Composition and recipe is true to label. Serving size is 5g per serve for me, frequent daily usage. Gives some energy for training. Great Quality."
6,129090,2024-04-04,Great product ( at night for sleep you must take 2),"What impressed me is how quickly my orders were delivered ... I live in Greece and I shopped there several years ago, they impose duties and taxes on us at customs.!! Now everything goes through Europe and you don't pay anything extra, The last two orders were placed on 24/03/2024 and today 04/04/2024 they were delivered a little while ago..!! I have no doubts about the quality of the products because everything is made in USA... and I have tried them, I hope to continue buying from there if the prices do not change because it is cheaper than Greece...!!"
7,129090,2023-11-16,Something I didn't know,This product surprised me quite a lot. I took it for the first time about a week ago and slept very well indeed. I want to buy some more but at present the product is out of stock. That is a shame but the company will contact me as soon as it is back in stock.  I can't wait! 
8,129090,2024-06-12,One of the better extracts,"I actually just prefer taking large doses of the plain herb, but as far as extracts go this is one of the best. Great price, small capsules. "
9,129090,2024-03-29,很好！,"As I have anxiety disorder, so always take medicine like Xanax to relieve it. However after trying this product, it also works well with my symptoms, so I recommend this to those people also have anxiety disorder."

I recommend taking it early because it may give me a deep and long sleep and I wake up sleepy for work! It is better to sleep a little earlier. "
59,129090,2024-09-20,,"I occasionally use passionflower because it is said to be good for sleep and circadian rhythm (body clock). However, it seems a little pricey because it is not available from many brands. This brand was cheap, so I bought it for the first time in a while. I take it a little before going to bed. I also take magnesium, but I am grateful that I can now fall asleep easily without relying on melatonin. It doesn't linger until morning and I don't have any other problems, so it seems to suit me. I plan to continue taking it."

This is also cheap, and it's from a manufacturer I've never bought from before, so I was a bit hesitant at first, but it works. It makes me feel relaxed and sleepy."

95,129090,2024-07-28,what time is it?,"The most noticeable thing was the calmness of my mind before going to bed. Even when I was dizzy from work stress, taking passionflower made me feel calm. This is because the flavonoids contained in passionflower act on GABA receptors and have a calming effect. I feel that my daytime tension has also eased and my stress resistance has increased. I can now calmly respond to sudden situations. It makes sense that passionflower regulates the secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol. The history of passionflower is interesting. It was discovered in South America by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, and was named after the ""Passion of Christ"" because of the unique shape of its flowers. It is said that indigenous people have used it as a sedative since ancient times. It gives the impression of a fusion of tradition and science. I also felt an improvement in my concentration. My thoughts, which tended to be anxious and scattered, became more organized. This may be because passionflower has the effect of suppressing excessive neurotransmission. Before going to bed rather than when waking up. Recommended for those who suffer from anxiety and stress in modern society, especially those looking for gentle support from natural sources."
