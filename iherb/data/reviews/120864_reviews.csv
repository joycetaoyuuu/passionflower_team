0,120864,2024-05-09,FACTOR FORCE,Factor force magnesium chewable cubes are individually packaged within the resealable bottle.  I plan on taking it solely at night to help my body restore at rest/sleep. Magnesium has helped my joint health and muscle recovery. It tastes more like caramel than creamsicles but delicious nonetheless.  Hoping these will help to balance my hormone production. 
1,120864,2024-04-21,Great!,"Word of warning, take this only at night before bed, It works so well that after only taking one chewable (around 2pm)  I was so relaxed and drowsy that all I wanted to do was tuck myself in bed and sleep for hours lol.  I don't want to imagine what would have happened if I had taken 2 haha.  "
2,120864,2024-07-07,Fantastic Magnesium Chew with a Calming Support Complex,"Have been pleased with the recent purchase of Force Factor, Ultimate  Magnesium.  I take it after my last meal a few hours before bedtime.  It helps with unwinding and relaxation to help complete the day before retiring for a good night's sleep.  I give the product 5 stars (5 out of 5 stars) "
3,120864,2024-07-04,Wow wow we wha!!!,I actually bought these for my 16 year old daughter who has a hard time falling asleep. Melatonin does not work for her. After reading reviews I decided to try this product for her. They are delicious and remind me of soft Werther's original candy. I dont have sleep issues but wanted to try them. I took two like it suggests. For me because I dont have problems falling asleep I felt 2 was too much. I recommend this product!!
4,120864,2024-09-01,Great tasting! Quality products!,Great tasting! Quality products! You feel the difference! These are the best tasting vitamins on the market! You get the wonderful health benefits and they taste like candy! :) Buy with confidence! 
5,120864,2024-02-27,Curious Little Squares,"Creamsicle...only if you really stop thinking about the magnesium that comes through in these. Yes, they have an ""orangish-vanilla"" flavor to them but they are not that great tasting. Thankfully they aren't too sweet as other companies tend to over sweeten their supplements. They melt easily, so keep them in a cool/dry place to avoid any issues (you can even pop them in the fridge or freezer for a minute or so before consuming but don't store them there due to the moisture). Not sure if they are effective as I didn't really pay attention while using them over a course of a few days. Most likely we won't buy again as there are other magnesium supplements that we like better (mainly gummy - though they tend to be coated in sugar unlike these; thus one drawback for gummies). Still they are worth a try if you don't like taking magnesium powders, capsules or tablets. Just beware, they tend to stick to the teeth & need to be brushed off if you don't chew them quickly (or taken with some water to help remove from the teeth)."
6,120864,2023-11-03,Just fine,"Tastes great, not sure how much it’s effective because I only take half a dose. However I do like it. Not sure if I would repurchase.

7,120864,2024-02-06,Delicious and soft to chew,The box is very large and it would have been possible to put more soft chew in there. I would have preferred it to come in a package of 120 soft chew jellies. Other than that the product is good
