0,116928,2024-04-29,Works well to aid sleep ,"Please keep making it. Only annoyance is that it runs out of stock often. My son gets very hyper at night, sometimes this product helps to get him off to sleep. A bit concerned about the B6 ingredient being so high, especially if taking other supplements. Too much B6 can cause nerve damage, so it's not something I'd give my child too often as he takes multivitamins that contain b complex some days. "
1,116928,2023-11-05,Children‚Äôs Anxiety works!!!!,"My daughter who suffers anxiety really bad, to the point where she gets quite unwell. Since starting these she‚Äôs been so much better still gets anxious but not to the point where she‚Äôs sick. My daughter has also expressed that it makes her feel relaxed in uncomfortable situations. Highly recommend this product."
2,116928,2023-10-30,Help my child feel more relaxed ,"This supplement is helpful to my child with OCD. When those challenging moments arise and OCD symptoms flare up, my child now asks for this supplement because she recognizes that it helps her feel more relaxed especially at night.  She needs to take 2 per day to see the difference (morning and evening), one is not enough."
3,116928,2024-04-11,Very good results for ADHD,"It's a good product for kids having problems with concentration and attention, and I will purchase more for my 3-grader. He is more calm and less agitated. 2 tablets per day work pretty well."
4,116928,2024-03-11,Helps with Anxiety + Stress,My son has high anxiety which can cause emotional dysregulation. These supplements make a big difference. They don't solve everything but we definitely notice a difference if he stops taking them! They help with managing anxiety and stress.
5,116928,2024-02-18,Helps Anxiety,My 5 year old daughter was struggling with shyness and social anxiety. Since starting these I‚Äôve seen an obvious change in her willingness to participate in social settings and she has become much less introverted. 
6,116928,2023-11-07,Anxiety comfort ,"These are amazing. They have changed my daughters world. We use 2 in the morning before school and one in the afternoon. She loves the taste, I only wish you could buy a bigger bottle . "
7,116928,2024-09-11,Too much b6 for a child !,"Although the ingredients seem great for anxiety and seem to help, there is WAY too much vitamin B6 in these for any child. Daily doses that high pose risk to nerve damage in the body. The worst part is they are recommending 1 to 2 tablets! 2 is insane. 1 tablet is 147% of daily requirement,  not to mention what your child gets from food...I would really err on the side of caution with these ,parents. Do your research! Also, lowering the amount  of B6 would make this much better."
8,116928,2024-10-17,Good,Just started it with my son but he likes the taste and it‚Äôs easy for kids to take. I know magnesium helps calm him so I‚Äôm excited to see if this works well. He has anxiety .
