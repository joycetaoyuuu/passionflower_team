0,39945,2024-09-25,Great,"NOW Foods Real Tea, Nighttime, Caffeine-Free is my go-to for a relaxing evening routine! This tea has a soothing blend of herbs that helps me unwind after a long day. The calming chamomile and delightful lavender create a comforting aroma that makes every cup feel special. I love that it’s caffeine-free, so I can enjoy it right before bed without worrying about disrupting my sleep. The taste is deliciously mellow and not overly sweet, making it perfect for those quiet moments of self-care. Since I started drinking this tea, I’ve noticed improved sleep quality and a more peaceful mind before bedtime. If you’re looking for a comforting, caffeine-free tea to help you relax and prepare for a good night’s sleep, I highly recommend NOW Foods Real Tea, Nighttime—it’s truly a lovely addition to my evening routine!"
1,39945,2024-08-03,Good taste,"I tried this tea and enjoyed it's full flavor. Unlike many herbal teas, the ingredients in this one make for a full, rich, and tasty drink that is not watery. I have since reordered it. My only criticism is that I must use a scissors to open the tea envelopes. They don't tear easily or at all. Not a big problem, but an easier open would be nice. Still, a delicious non-caffeine nighttime tea. Thumbs up."

24,39945,2012-05-10,They changed the active ingredients,"The previous nighttime tea from the NOW company was very minty, the flavor was very strong, soothing, calming and relaxing.  This is not the same nighttime tea that was available before, as the flavor is weak, it is not minty, and even using two tea bags doesn't make a big difference."

30,39945,2024-09-11,,"The quality is good, I think all the ingredients of iHerb are clean. The taste is normal. The ingredients are as written. The use is easy. The size is nice and suitable, and the box is also suitable for the quantity. The benefit is for sleep, but honestly, all those who are keen on sleep. If you are not able to sleep, you will not sleep even if you drink the entire box. But if you are able to sleep, it helps you more and more. Herbal tea, a mixture of several herbs without caffeine. Serving: Once almost daily. I vary between it and other companies from iHerb itself. Repeated purchase is possible.
"
31,39945,2024-01-03,Satisfying aroma and taste,"It has a strong mint flavor and is also sweet because it contains stevia leaves. I had trouble sleeping every weekend so I bought it to see if it would help, but I've only tried it once and it didn't seem to work. Even though I drank it warmly and drank it twice, I ended up having a nightmare with my eyes open for two or three hours. I'll have to try again next week. The packaging is a typical box packaging, and various herbs are blended. There is no caffeine~"
32,39945,2024-05-15,I will buy again,"It's very delicious. I'm glad that it's cheap and individually packaged. When I drink it at night after taking a bath, I feel like my mind is calming down. I'm not sure if it has any effect on my sleep, but I'll buy it again."
