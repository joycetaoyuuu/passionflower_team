Sometimes I have a small dosage to stave off panic attacks and such while at other times I will take more so that I can sleep. The ingredients are high quality. However, I find this to be very expensive for its size. Nevertheless, it works beautifully and tastes really good. "

2,56485,2014-10-31,"Works the best, but more costly.","I love this one.  Because of liquid formulation it seems to work a lot fast.

Absolutely amazing selection of herbs, that work just right for me, without valerian.   Valerian just does not work well and leaves me tired in the morning too.  So I avoid it.


The only downside, is it does not last long (i take more then recommended dose though, i am 2 meter tall and heavy."

7,56485,2018-03-31,Not impressed,"The husband because of nervous work for a long time badly sleeps. I decided to take homeopathic syrup to soothe and promote a good sleep. The medicine as a whole is not bad, there is a slight soothing, but the effect on the quality of sleep is not felt."
8,56485,2017-09-25,There was no effect on sleep.,"I recently bought it because I thought that I could help sleeping, but I could not sleep. I usually get used to drinking such herbal essence, or even if I rinse my mouth I was concerned about the smell like lavender that remained in my throat, it took as much as two hours, as usual, to sleep until I got to bed. Perhaps there is some relaxation effect. . ."
9,56485,2016-12-07,good,"I used to drink it before going to sleep, it helps to sleep comfortably, but it causes mild sleepiness, but it tastes good, but you need to drink 50 ml, which is a large amount of time, but it is expensive. The rest was a small amount, and you closed it. When you opened it, you got gas and you drank it. !"
