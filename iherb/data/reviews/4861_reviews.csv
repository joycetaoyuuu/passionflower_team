15,4861,2023-07-10,Stress Free & Happy! You need these!,"I'll start off by saying that I have always thought that I didn't have anxiety and that the stress I felt on a regular basis was normal. I am on a weight loss journey and my doctor said that my body is under high stress both by being overweight and that I'm working out.  I decided to take these after reading the reviews and my God!  Y'all these are amazing!  You feel the effects within 30 mins of taking them, you just feel good like happy, stress Free, anxiety free.  I wfh and normally hate going into the office because of the anxiety of getting dressed and being around people.  I took these before a work event and I ripped my pants right at the seam of the zipper as soon as I sat down in my meeting.  Had I not taken the Happy Camper pills, I would've been freaking out and felt like a spotlight was on me the moment my pants ripped.  But I didn't freak out, I just said ""hmm oh well"" and pulled down my shirt and stayed the rest of the meeting.  Later that day, my shoe broke and again, I didn't freak out - I said ""oh wow, they broke"" and gripped my toes to the shoe and kept going üòÇ Non Happy Camper Brandy would've been done with the day and would have had to leave the office immediately.  That being said, these are amazing!! buy them! you need them!  And on my weight loss journey, working out seems to be an easier task because I'm not focused on the scary part of going to the gym.  Amazing product, I will continue to buy them ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

17,4861,2024-04-17,Felt weird,I really wanted to like this product.  It gave me anxiety.
18,4861,2023-06-10,,"I have used Happy Camper for 20 years, whenever I had a stressful situation, couldn't sleep, anxious, whatever the need.  It is the perfect herbal calming, NOT DOPING, ""helper""."
19,4861,2022-11-08,Excellent! Wake me up!,"On the days that you need more than just your espresso, reach for one of these capsules.  You'll think clearer and are ready to take on the day.  Whatever it brings!"
20,4861,2022-01-24,We love Happy Camper !,My husband is recovering from taking an antipsychotic used off label  and rather than replace it with another heavy hitter that causes multiple side effects ..we are working with herbs and supplements to ease him through ...Happy Camper helps when he is having a rough time. I am not saying drop your meds and take Happy Camper I am saying for us ...self included as I take as needed also ...you can‚Äôt beat the nice steady calm ....the quality is there and the ingredients are beneficial.

29,4861,2022-12-07,,Excellent product! Happy Campers take the rough edges off of your day.
30,4861,2024-09-19,did not like,I found the taste a bit off putting so I can't really comment. 
31,4861,2024-01-16,,Did not have any effect whatsoever for our autistic child.
32,4861,2023-09-30,maybe,Not sure if it helped me or not. tried it for 2 weeks then stopped. so not really sure
33,4861,2019-01-14,"Nice effect, maybe too strong.","I bought this after trying the Kava product of the same company that I like...this one seems to have a more sleeping effect on me.
When I tried only 1 pill instead of the 2 recommended it seems it's more calming without the knockout/depressing effect.
Will try it more before deciding if its right for me,  or if I just get back to simply Kava alone."
34,4861,2017-03-20,Not just mood changing.. LIFE CHANGING!,"Whether it is a placebo effect or it actually works... this product changed my life! I'm an anxiety-prone, which also makes me prone to depression. However, with the help of this product, I was able to stabilize my every day mood and emotions and even was able to work myself off of the medications I was taking. Natural Balance is amazing and I will forever be grateful for their natural remedy to boost my mood and mentality! "
35,4861,2010-02-22,"Natural Balance, Happy Camper, 120 Veggie Caps","Love it, love it and have been recommending to all my friends. This product takes the edge off stress!!! Does not make you drowsy but is awesome on the daily stess that life brings. If having an extremely ""bad hair day"" I will take 2 capsules.They work quite fast. You just start to relax and you have a smile again!! Highly recommend if you let stress get to you. Love it!!"
36,4861,2009-08-11,Happy Camper lives up to it's name!,"I have been taking these off and on for years and they work awesome.  My mood lifts and I feel so much better on those icky days.  My husband has recently started taking them when needed and he has noticed a big difference in mood too.  We take them one at a time though, not two at once because I've found the kola nut will give us jitters if we take two at once.  All and all a great product!"
37,4861,2008-11-23,I like it.,"I ordered this product because life was getting the best of me and I was feeling like anxiety was keeping me from dealing with life challenges in a positive way.  After I began taking it I noticed a change right away.  I take this with a ginko biloba/B complex and daily vitamin in the morning with my breakfast and feel ready for the day by the time I'm out the door.  I was laid off about two weeks after I started taking Happy Camper and I really think it helped me calmly assess the situation and move on towards finding another job quickly rather than get overwhelmed and depresed and give up as I've unfortunately done in the past.  If you see yourself in any of these situations consider this product, it helps."
38,4861,2008-11-24,Fabulous Happy Camper,"I once wrote to the manufacturer the following regarding this product.  I told them that back in 1999 I was caretaking my ill sister, feeling very dark.  I purchased a sample of HC and within an hour it was like the sun had risen in my head."
39,4861,2023-10-03,Hurts my stomach,Contains a stimulant so I felt jittery then my stomach hurt. So I only took it once and gave it away. My friend said it did not help her. 
40,4861,2011-03-28,Overall pleasantly surprised ,"This product is great if taken in the morning or by midday, but I really wish they had a night-time formula that was caffeine/gotu kola free. I don't like how the dosage of each herb and plant in this product is not specifically listed on the bottle. It just says it is a proprietary blend, so you don't know how much of what herbal component you are really getting in a single dose. Overall the blend is great, I take 2 gels around 10 AM and feel a nice balance between calm yet not drowsy, but neither over hyped either. (people sensitive to caffeine may find 2 at once to be a bit much) Drinking a caffeinated beverage immediately brings back the upper effect once the initial thrust wears off. All in all an excellent product. Of all the other people I know who have tried or use it regularly, they all give it 2 thumbs up."
41,4861,2010-03-06,Very satisfied with Happy Camper!,"I have been on multiple prescription medications for depression for the past 15 years.  During that time I have been on various brands and have had all sorts of side effects.  I became interested in herbal and ""natural"" remedies and decided to try them to decrease some of the side effects I was having.

Happy Camper has truly been amazing and worked VERY WELL for me.  My overall mood is much improved and my crying spells are now significantly fewer.  It is the best medication I have used in the last 15 years for depression.  I also feel better knowing that is is more natural and better for my body than what I was using.  

P.S.  My wife is also very happy since I've been taking Happy Camper!  She says I'm not NEARLY as cranky!!     "
42,4861,2008-09-15,Happy Camper is what I am,"This is one of my favorite herbal complexes.  It really does provide a gentle balance between stimulants and relaxation, putting me in a good mood.  It contains caffeine, so it really is best for occasional use.  But it is great to have around for those times when you could use a better mood!"
43,4861,2008-03-21,My Old Favorite,"I started using Happy Camper years ago to counter the extreme stress of my job.  It is a wonderful product and have no problem using it at age 73.  I take it as needed. I can't find it anymore in my area, so I was so grateful to oder it from IHerb, at a significant savings.
"
44,4861,2007-03-29,great stuff !!,"this is great stuff !! works right away , no need to wait a week for it to build up in my blood stream !! one pill keeps me from frowning , 2 make me smile -- and no tapering off either !! if i do not need it , i just do not take it that day !! great stuff !!"
45,4861,2023-10-06,"I bought it, but i dont know how it works","I bought it, but i dont know how it works.
I gonna try it"
46,4861,2022-04-11,,I love this stuff! Ive been using this for many years to help with anxiety. 
47,4861,2021-08-22,,"This is the only product that has Ever worked, just a suttle lift of feeling less of a edge and more relaxed with the day  Highly Recommend this"
48,4861,2019-11-27,Be a Happy Camper!,The most awesome herb for taking you out of the blues. Even the depths of when you begin to dive deep into the abyss Happy Camper gets you back on track.
49,4861,2017-02-20,I love this product.  ,"Unbelievable price compared to our local health food store.  I've asked my husband to use it, and it has made a nice, peaceful difference in our life!  Thanks iHerb!  Glad I found you :)"
50,4861,2016-09-04,Changed my life!,"I've used prescription anti-depressant medication in the past. Although some of them worked really well, they all had horrific side-effects.
I wish I'd known about this product years ago! It eliminated the depression AND anxiety I was experiencing, all without any side effects.
I've used this across time during various periods including when I was severely depressed and moderately depressed.  With the severe depression I found I had to take a second dosage mid-day and then it worked way better. I was concerned about the kava warning but I heard it was some weird fluke with one person. I avoid alcohol when I take the medication, but I've taken it in the morning and then had a beer at the end of the day and no problem. I don't know if excessive alcohol consumption would be a problem with this or not. I encourage anyone who has been struggling with anxiety or depression to give this a try if they aren't taking anything else it could interact with. If you don't want to take prescription medicine, this is a GREAT alternative! I feel fantastic from taking this stuff. It doesn't numb the emotions, and of course I still can feel sad about something that is sad. But it definitely improves my mood dramatically."
51,4861,2009-12-01,Taking the edge off,"Happy Camper helps me through some stressful business days.  I can work through problems and time sensitive stress with strong sense of anxiety and frustration. After taking 2 capsules there is no overt change in my disposition, but they take the edge off of irritation and moodiness."
52,4861,2009-08-21,Stress Relief!,"This product really helps me through those hormonal days when I would rather not have to BE with other people, but have not choice.  :)  It isn't habit-forming, and it takes the edge off of those feelings of stress."
53,4861,2009-06-30,works great,I have used this for years and I can really tell a difference.  It helps on those days when you just don't feel like yourself.  I wouldn't go without it.
54,4861,2009-03-13,Thumbs up!,"When I have a family outing and need a little boost of positive energy, Happy Camper always does the trick.  Just makes me more alert and happy. I only take on special days when I need an extra pick-me-up."
55,4861,2009-03-03,Works Great,I take 2 Each morning and it makes me happy and have energy through out the day.  Its the only thing that gives me motivation
56,4861,2009-03-03,happy happy joy joy,"Happy Camper works beautifully. I find if I only use them 2-3 times a week, the effect is consistently good. The first time, I took them, I ""crashed"" and got really tired. Only the first time, though. Love them!"
57,4861,2007-10-21,Happy Camper,"A friend told me about this product.  She wouldn't be without it over the long winter months in Oregon.  Many people including me have the SADD syndrome during winter.  I haven't tried these yet, but I think they will help during those cold dark days!"
58,4861,2022-10-13,,Been using this product for years. Very happy with it. Good product for your money.
59,4861,2011-07-29,"Calming, except....","This product works. I does induce a nice, mellow natural calmness. Such a pleasant effect. I purchased it in the hopes it would calm me down at work...I teach elementary school :)
But after I bought it, I read up on Kava Kava a little, and now I am concerned that it may not be good for my liver to take this too often. Overuse MAY lead to liver toxicity and an increase in HDL cholesterol. This is under debate because some believe it's the aflatoxin molds on the plant that cause the problem (much the same situation as with peanut products).
It's still probably safer than drinking alcohol. So I reserve it for those jittery PMS days and for situations fraught with Social Anxiety, such as holidays.
Wish I did not worry about the Kava Kava."
60,4861,2021-09-15,Relaxing effect,"This product has a nice, relaxing effect and is great before bed to relax before a nice, long sleep. If taken in the day it won't make you too sleepy, and is good at any time to relax the body and mind. "
61,4861,2020-03-28,"Despite the image of someone reclining, this product contains caffeine, and much more of an upper!","Watch out! It contains kola nut, so it's got a bit of caffeine. Great earlier in the day, but if I use it later in the day I have trouble sleeping. I like the product, but it is not what I was looking for."
62,4861,2017-05-14,Effective but makes me tired,Its great to calm me down and breath.. i take it on an empty belly and I can feel the effect with 20 minutes. Downside is that it makes me really tired a few hours later
63,4861,2012-10-04,Amazing Stuff,"For years, I've used Happy Camper to sharpen my brain and my attitude, especially when I have a class to teach or an important meeting."
64,4861,2011-04-21,HAPPY ...Happy...Camper ,"Happy Camper really helps me to have a smooth lift to lethargy. I feel almost as if I were a 20 something again. It does not feel like too much caffeine would, just a very pleasant  and motivating type feeling. "
65,4861,2010-09-09,Natural pick-me-up,This is a great formula. One of my favorite characteristics about this formula is you don't have to take in daily in order for it to work for you. 
66,4861,2010-05-20,Love it!,"i can definitly tell a difference in mood and it doesnt make me jittery at all. I love it, but i think my husband and kids love it even better! hahaha"
67,4861,2010-05-01,Keep a smile on your face even under stress,"One of the best products to help chase the blues away naturally.

Whenever that melancholy cloud comes rolling in or I start to feel grumpy I reach for Happy Camper.  I'm smiling again soon without a sharp peak and a hard crash.  Just a ""peaceful easy feeling""."
68,4861,2010-03-12,happy camper back to normal,"I have used this product over the years and when
I am having a little craziness in my life I take
the happy camper till I am back to normal.  "
69,4861,2009-12-15,Mellow-yellow,"I've taken antidepressants for years, but sometimes when the dark days are dragging on or in times of high stress, I take Happy Camper.  It works quite well, creating a pleasant, calm state. "
70,4861,2009-12-04,Awesome!,I have been taking this for about 2 years now! It really helps my mood! I am very calm in situations and I think it is because of this! 
71,4861,2009-08-16,Works in the beginning,"The first time I took these pill, they worked sooo well!!  The next couple of time not so well.  So now I'm taking them when I know for sure I'm going to need a little boost.  "
72,4861,2009-07-13,Great,"This is a great product and relaxes me when i take them. I've used them before and love the. This was about 1/2 the price of the local shops here, as well as the lowest on the internet.

Thanks again!"
73,4861,2009-02-19,Happy Camper,"Seriously - I am a much Happier Camper these days!  I've been taking Happy Camper on a regular basis for about 4 months, am a menopausal woman and definitely feel less weepy.  Love it!"
74,4861,2008-12-11,great stuff,This combination is great at making you feel calmer without putting you to sleep.  I take it during the day when I have a stressfull day and it's wonderful.
75,4861,2008-10-22,Very satisfied customer!,"I found the exact item I wanted, received it within a week, and I am very satisfied with the great service I received from iHerb.com"
76,4861,2022-07-25,Keeping her a happy camper,"I don't know if it's just the great name or if they work, but my wife thinks that they are just fine."
77,4861,2022-10-20,,"im not sure if it has any benefit , didnt really work for me "
78,4861,2011-04-18,Somewhat Helpful,Have only used a few times.  This does seem to take the edge off nervousness or a bad mood - not overly strong and didn't make me sleepy.  Will revise this once I've used the product a bit longer.
79,4861,2011-11-23,Pretty good,"Not bad for what it is, undertones of kava and passion flower give a bit of a pleasant buzz. if only true piece of mind could be found in a tablet"
80,4861,2021-12-01,Not sure if it works for me?,My mom swears by these but I didn't really notice an improvement on days I took these 
81,4861,2021-09-10,,"They work but somehow if you take more than 2 capsules, you won't feel any more different lol"
82,4861,2021-04-23,This helps me chill out!,This is a nice subtle way to relax. It's a good alcohol alternative.
83,4861,2021-03-06,,"I like this in place of other caffeine products; it has a balance that ‚Äòfits‚Äô me
Thank you üôèüôèüôè"
84,4861,2021-02-12,,I suffer from anxiety. Happy Camper helps me feel easy going and relaxed.
85,4861,2021-01-17,,Cannot live without this product! Takes the edge off and anxiety so you can manage with a clear head. 
86,4861,2020-05-04,This will change your life!!!,"I‚Äôve used Happy Camper for at least 7 years. I love it. I needed something and tried it and taken it ever since. I‚Äôve told numerous people about it. I wish I owned stock in it. Lol. 

Happy Camper is exactly what it says. A natural feel good formula. It‚Äôs subtle too. You take it and it takes the edge off. You don‚Äôt stress. 

That is HUGE. I never realized how much my mental stress caused me physical exhaustion and lack of focus on what I needed to do. 

I have physical energy and focus to be productive without it being a huge chore. I just want to. It‚Äôs so natural!  

Some people tell me after  a day or two ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt feel anything‚Äô.  There‚Äôs a reason for that!  You do feel something but there no rush like caffeine or other stimulants.  There no  tiredness with some stress formulas. I have taken them all so I know how they can affect you.  It‚Äôs NATURAL. 

Just keep taking it!  Set your alarm for the times it states in directions.  You will find yourself in a good mood. You will not react to fools around you.  You will not feel overwhelmed or get uptight. You will just be able to ride out your day in a good mood. 

You will start to look at your undone chores and just do them. You won‚Äôt feel overwhelmed or paralyzed by them any more. You will have more physical energy because you have it available because you are not stressing which drains your physical energy. 

I live my life on this stuff.  For years I took two. Now I take one after breakfast or something to eat. Another after lunch and one at night after dinner. I sleep well and wake up energized. 

Not everyone will need three a day.  I have a very busy and stressful life. Wheelchair bound veteran hubby with loss of use of both feet. Bedbound a lot of the time. I am busy every minute and I can get overwhelmed and turn into a pity party pretty fast. Depression is just there waiting for me to trip up and grab me. Oh no!!! NO. I KEEP POSITIVE BECAUSE OF HAPPY CAMPER. 

I‚Äôm in balance because of this product!  I buy it before I‚Äôm close to running out. I have several bottles I keep.  One in my bathroom.  One in my kitchen. One in my purse.  One at my kid‚Äôs homes. Lol. 

I can only say what it does for me. It‚Äôs my lifeline. And no side effects. None. 

As a former psychiatric nurse I know the benefit of taking appropriate medications for some conditions. 

I have ADHD. I have suffered depression before. IF THIS PRODUCT DID NOT KEEP ME BALANCED I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE MEDICATION TO HELP ME.  WITHOUT HESITATION. I WANT AND NEED TO BE HAPPY. FOCUSED. PRODUCTIVE. PEOPLE DEPEND ON ME. ME FIRST OF ALL 

But the results I get with Happy Camper are positive and keep me in balance. Has for years. So I‚Äôm ok with this. 

GIVE IT A TRY!!!  And it‚Äôs so affordable!! 
"
87,4861,2008-06-24,David,"In all honesty, I was very dissapointed in the product.  I had done quite a bit of research because I'm going through a very bad bought of depression right now, and instead of turning to ""drugs"", I was hoping to use something a little more over the counter.  I found out about the 'Happy Camper' product, but it made about as much difference as a Vitamin C, meaning, it did nothing noticable.

Maybe it may work for others, but I will not be purchasing that product anymore.  Also, in comparison to something like St. John's Wort, I think St.Johns makes a little bit of a difference, but not happy camper."
88,4861,2022-04-25,,"We love the happy camper, very helpful"
89,4861,2010-12-24,feel good herbs,This really does work in ever so slight ways. We feel calmer and more relaxed and would order this again or suggest it to our friends.
90,4861,2020-12-16,,Good for boosting attitude during dark winter months. Excellent service from iherb
91,4861,2016-12-06,Mood Stablizer,This product has helped stabilize my moods and help me become more productive
92,4861,2012-03-29,package arrived fast...product as good as sucking on an ice cube,"Now, I must say I was really happy for a bit with Natural Balance, Happy Camper, but that was because the packaged arrived so quickly.  Taking the campers in doses of two, four, and eight had no noticeable effect on me.  I will also say that I wasn't depressed before taking the pills and was searching for some sort of euphoric experience.  So, may if you are depressed, it may work; otherwise, I'm thinking that only the placebo effect will get someone feeling as if on cloud 9 as the picture on the bottle implies."
93,4861,2012-02-29,,"It is the feeling that is comfortable from morning when I drink.
But you should avoid the combination with the alcohol."
94,4861,2011-12-31,simply the best,"Due to a stressful job dealing with the public, I couldn't do it successfully without Happy Camper!!!!"
95,4861,2010-10-14,I am a HAPPY CAMPER!,"This is a great product, take only when you need it, and it should put you in a much better state of mind.  "
96,4861,2010-02-23,Happy Camper with Happy Camper,"I like these so much, I bought a bottle for my daughter. Better than prescription drugs any day!"
