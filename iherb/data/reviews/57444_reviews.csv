This product though is much better, it uses a scientifically valid method of mg(milligrams) and you can see that the capsules are full of plant matter.

83,57444,2024-06-29,It is a support,"I had muscle discomfort and this helped me a little to improve the symptoms before taking paracetamol.

I began to drink these capsules 2-3 before bedtime, my sleep became much better and calmer. At night I didn’t wake up from pain and in the morning my back muscles were much more relaxed than usual. If earlier it was necessary to do exercises or lie on an acupuncture mat, now this is not necessary. I drink regularly. The price is quite high, so I only drink at night."
88,57444,2024-03-13,Good product,"I take 3 capsules a day, divided into 3 times, and I think it's pretty good. The capsules smell very strong herbal and feel natural. I'm willing to try it again. Taking the capsule earlier in the evening seems to help digestion and absorption."
