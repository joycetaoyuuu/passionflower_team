0,68757,2024-09-09,A good PTS without melatonin ,"I got this power to sleep because it does not contain melatonin which can give you nightmares if you take too much. I‚Äôll mix it with the other PTS to reduce the melatonin. This one contains California poppy that helps you sleep for an alternative to the melatonin. It seems like a quality brand that provides liquid capsules instead of dry. I feel liquid is fresher and contains a more efficacious delivery of the constituents-vitamins/supplements ingredients. The size is not huge-50 pills which they want you to take 3. I‚Äôll take 2, and one of the other ‚Äòpower to sleep‚Äô (with melatonin) capsules to round it out. I got it on sale 28% off so bought 3! I should have enough to last for a while till the next sale."
1,68757,2024-05-22,Nice relaxing sleep facilitator ,I like this ‚Äúpower to sleep‚Äù by Irwin Naturals because it contains California poppy which is a gentle relaxer. I believe it also is a mild pain reliever because it‚Äôs related to poppies. I will usually take one of these with the other Irwin power to sleep that has melatonin included in it. I mix the two because I don‚Äôt like nightmares from too much melatonin. The size is a little smaller than the other style but I like the poppy ingredient so I ordered 2 bottles to balance the other P.T.S. They are also soft gels so works faster than tablets. Irwin I believe is a good quality supplement so I order several different kinds. 
2,68757,2024-07-04,Welcome relief,"Like many I have trouble staying asleep at night, and this product has aided my ability to stay asleep and avoid the 3:00 am wake up.  I can't write enough nice things about this sleep aid other than to say this comes with my full recommendation. "
3,68757,2024-03-15,"Gel cap is big, but effective","Gel cap is big, but since it is a gel cap, not too hard to swallow.  taken along with L-theanine and Gaba, seems to help me get good night's sleep.  "
4,68757,2023-08-24,wonderful product,"I have used Irwin Naturals Power to sleep pm before; I was thrilled when I realized it comes in a melatonin free formula. I have a provider who doesn't want me to take too much melatonin in my sleep products because it's actually a hormone. I believe Irwins' are high quality products, I like what all of these specific ingredients do and there's no taste issues in a gel cap. The benefit overall is a product that works."
5,68757,2024-04-27,Melatonin free,"I guess I relied on sleeping pills prescribed by my doctor for a very long time that I thought why not try homeopathy.   This isn't drug based so if you are looking for instant sleep after a day of stress, this is not IT.  You have to relax your mind and body first for this to work."
6,68757,2024-10-10,Power to Sleep ,I take two of these every night before bed. Then I take another that has melatonin in it!
7,68757,2023-10-01,Great Alternative,"It's a bit pricey but I have been looking for something with none, or less melatonin. It works for me! I am repurchasing it now"
8,68757,2024-04-04,,Apparently good quality ingredients and dosage but it didn't work for me. 
9,68757,2017-12-03,Works,"Works, and it does not include Valerian that I cannot use. 
Price is little bit high."
10,68757,2017-06-21,Too soon.......,"Just started using so not fair to evaluate. My sleep was scattered and not helpful. Hope to use for a week, at least, to be fair. Will let you know.............."
11,68757,2018-08-13,Looked promising but didn' work for me,"I was originally looking for a formula that had California Poppy in it but settled for this as the herbal ingredients looked promising. For whatever reason it did not work well for me at all.  I suggest taking this well in advance of when you need to be asleep.  I was taking it approximately 30 minutes before and it didn't seem to kick in at all till a couple of hours later, plus I still woke up after a few hours sleep."
12,68757,2024-09-23,It helped me a lot with my immune system.,"This is a wonderful sleep aid. I liked it in several ways: 1. Price 2. Great taste 3. Product quality 4. Excellent result 5. Convenient packaging and useful ingredients, the ability to choose the size and dosage 6. Great benefit for prevention 7. Natural ingredients I recommend this wonderful mineral to everyone, it fully corresponds to the description and expectations."
13,68757,2024-04-02,It worked until the second day,"I purchased this product because I thought the quality of the ingredients was high.I wonder if it doesn't contain valerian.I feel like I became more alert during the course, but I think it worked until the second day I took it.It's a soft gel tablet, so I took it. Easy and tasteless"
14,68757,2024-04-12,,"It seems like a good complex, just a little expensive, but it contains a lot of useful things, I‚Äôll try it"
