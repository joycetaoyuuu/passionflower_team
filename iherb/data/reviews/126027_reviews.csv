0,126027,2024-04-22,Nice!,"I bought this after seeing it in a youtube vlog about bath products with nice packaging, but I was surprised how much I liked the product itself! The scent is very subtle and soothing, at least in comparison to other bubble baths. I think it is perfect for kids or people that are sensitive to smells, as the smell isn't artificial. Would love to try the other options once they restock! :)"
1,126027,2023-10-02,Great scent but no bubbles,"I bought this because the package is so cute and the ingredients seem to be gentle ( not too chemical). 
And results were
-the scent was great!
-easy to measure without mess
-the bubble was .... I didn't see any bubbles!

If you are looking for something bubbly maybe this is not a choice. But for others, looking for something smells nice and  safe for kids, this is great!
Overall I like this Aromasaurus.

3,126027,2023-10-03,Great,"There's a whole hunt for this salt, it's the sweetest price. I have been using it for a long time, for a runny nose, as a natural inhalation in the bathroom."
4,126027,2024-03-25,良い,No bubble. Good scent for my kids 2 and 4 years old
5,126027,2024-01-05,No bubbles,"While I enjoy the scent and the calming effect of the product, it produces zero bubbles. "
6,126027,2024-02-20,No bubbles / good scent,"Could not get any bubbles, even when using the personal shower on the highest setting to agitate the water.  The scent was good but if you are looking for bubble for the kids skip this one."
7,126027,2024-09-15,No fizz or smell,It's just powder. the smell is non existent and doesn't even amke any bubbles. 
8,126027,2024-01-29,No bubbles,Smells nice but absolutely no bubbles. And we followed the directions and tried many times.
9,126027,2024-04-11,fragrant,It tastes very good. Children like it very much. They feel it can relieve fatigue. I use a lot of it and will buy it again.
10,126027,2024-02-19,Great,I'm trying to understand how this foam works. I add it to the bath but there is no foam. There is a bathroom scent. Economical packaging
11,126027,2024-08-31,Great smell but not foamy,"Cool packaging, great scent, but doesn't lather with just water. Comes in the format of a white powder that dissolves in water. After a few times, we discovered that if you add normal body soap to the water, the powder starts to foam. I really liked the packaging and the smell, but I don't think I will buy again."
12,126027,2024-04-05,foam without foam,"It says foam, but there is no foam. The water becomes cloudy, as if milk was added and that’s it. The smell is pleasant, that's all. The jar is small in size, but lasts a long time. I won't order again. Did the child begin to sleep more soundly? No) as usual, everything didn’t fall into bed after the bath))) I tried it myself and also didn’t notice much more relaxation than from other remedies"
13,126027,2024-03-18,GOOD!,"Sweet scent and good size! I use it on my 2 and 4 year old children, who have sensitive skin... I use 1 cap! Beautiful composition, and use it once a week as needed. I recommend ! Small 👍 if this helped you! Thanks 🤗 "
14,126027,2024-07-07,,Aromatic put a little in the bath opens the respiratory tract recommends ordering
15,126027,2024-04-20,Excellent ,"Great quality, the best I've ever bought, I'll buy more often"
16,126027,2024-01-27,No bubbles,"When I looked closely, the instructions didn't say that it would make a lot of bubbles, but it did say it was a bubble bath, so I looked it up in the bubble bath category and thought it would come up, so I bought it, but it was 1-2 cups full? Is it enough to fill the lid with about 2 cups of hot water and only a few bubbles appear for a moment? (I think it's a standard bathtub.) I added about 3 more cups from there, but there were almost no bubbles...Maybe it's not bad as a bath salt, but I bought it expecting a bubble bath, so this is it. I am giving it a Yu evaluation."
17,126027,2023-10-07,,"An aromatherapy sleep bath with Aromasaurus and a special blend of relaxing organic herbs, essential oils, vitamins and minerals is a safe and natural way to promote sound, restful and restorative sleep."
18,126027,2024-04-17,,"It was described as a bubble bath, but there was hardly any foam."
19,126027,2024-02-02,Foaming is normal,"Powder type bubble bath. It doesn't lather as well, but it smells great! The packaging also features dinosaurs, which children will love."
20,126027,2024-03-26,,"No bubbles, but tastes good"
21,126027,2024-08-11,We didn't have fun,"I don't know if we didn't do something right. Did not make bubbles. Not a bad smell. In short, less"
22,126027,2024-02-16,,"completely failed to produce any bubbles. No bubbles, no fragrance"
