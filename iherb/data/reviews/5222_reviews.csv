39,5222,2023-10-19,,"I love that iHerb offers an alcohol-Free passionflower tincture. It is difficult to find alcohol-free tinctures readily available at any stores. I‚Äôve tried a few different brands and Nature‚Äôs Answer has the most pleasant taste. It reminds me of a really strong tea flavor. Which is so much more pleasant than an astringent flavor of the tinctures with alcohol. The quality of this brand feels much higher than others, and I‚Äôd boil that down to the flavor and consistent effects and benefit I derive from this brand in particular. Passionflower was recommended by my acupuncturist to support me in managing anxiety, stress, and falling asleep more easily without waking up in a panic. I have seen improvement in my sleep quality. It works very well for me. I take a dropper full with about 6 ounces of water before bed, and get cozy. I am generally asleep within 15 minutes. Please keep in mind I have taken other measures to support myself in processing anxiety and that there are many things to consider. However, Passionflower is a tremendous support to add to other methods you are exploring. I will also consume a half a dropper full for particularly stressful or emotionally taxing days to relax my nervous system and think more clearly. It has been a super helpful supplement for me and I hope it could be of support to you as well. All the best to you and your well-being!"
40,5222,2023-04-27,Great product for relaxation,I order this Passionflower extract not for the first time. It is a very good product. It is not only help to relax and get calm but also has good taste (usually such products do not have a good taste). I like to take these drops in combination with valerian root (for more efficiency) with half glass water. When I cry it helps me to calm and stop crying.  My husband also takes it sometimes when he has a lot of stress at work and it also helps him. I also very like that this product do not contain alcohol. So I recommend this product. 
41,5222,2022-11-22,A must have,"This stuff is gold! As someone who is quite sensitive and prone to nerves and getting anxious, I‚Äôve found this to be a tremendous help with calming me down. I use it all the time especially before I‚Äôm about to give a presentation at work or have a difficult conversation that I‚Äôm anxious about. I also use it throughout the day as I find it so effective in general. I love that it‚Äôs natural and alcohol free. I‚Äôve used passionflower before with a practitioner so I‚Äôm really glad I could find a high quality product as I would never be without it. For me the taste isn‚Äôt an issue as I gulp it down with water and the dropper bottle is very handy. "
42,5222,2024-09-19,It's extremely bitter.,I bought this tincture because I heard how passionflower is a good sedative. But to be honest I cannot give an accurate conclusion to that because it is insanely bitter! Bitter to the point that I am afraid to touch the bottle. Perhaps if you can tolerate the taste and use it at length it may very well benefit and sedate you. But I was unable to come to that conclusion after the 2 times I took it.
43,5222,2024-01-14,,"This items was everything I expected. Purchasing and delivery processes were seamless. Health benefits were notable. I feel extra energy in my muscles. It does not have any taste. Quality ingredients were used in this packaging. I liked having this item in my diet, it help with my training and musical compositions."

We only tried it once because the child didn't like the taste, so it's hard for me to say if the product is of high quality. At the moment we don't see a significant change, continue to try another similar product."
45,5222,2024-09-16,Tincture that helps you calm down and sleep ,I‚Äôve found that taken a dropper of this 30 mins before bed helps me stay asleep through the night. Has a bitter taste but not too bad.

47,5222,2024-01-23,OK,"I've tried this for my anxiety disorder. They say passionflower help as much as benzo, but I haven't seen many results. It depends on your anxiety level as well. If it's too severe, no plant will help. 
Valerian helped me more."
48,5222,2023-10-21,Passion flower extract ,"Quality ok , not sure if it works though , the taste needs a little getting used to . I still take it on occasion but I must admit I cannot tell if it works for me hence the 5 star "
49,5222,2024-08-25,The best,"Once we tried this passion flora,  now we use it every time when required. Effectiveness undoubtedly best. Highly recommend "
50,5222,2023-07-23,,"When there was insomnia, and nothing helped, this passionflower somehow relaxed, it turned out to fall asleep on a good dosage. But I want to share my experience: insomnia, which does not go away on conventional sedatives, will always have another cause. It was intoxication for me. I picked up the right vitamin - sleep returned from the first pill. Before that, Paul Eicherba tried sedatives, all to no avail, because they do not work with the cause. I didn't take melatonin because I think it goes too deep into the hormonal balance, up to the regulation of sex hormones. Andrew Guberman does not advise (Google who it is)."
51,5222,2023-07-11,my long-time go-to,"my doc recommended passionflower for sleep issues after a brain injury, and ever since then i've been using this on and off for YEARS to help me calm down before bed and help me sleep through the night. i also take it if i wake up in the middle of the night and need to relax and get back to sleep. i just put half a dropper under my tongue and keep it there for a minute or two before swallowing. it's not a dramatic effect, just peaceful and effective. just knowing it's in my bedside drawer makes me feel safe and secure lol i love this stuff"
52,5222,2022-12-06,Love this,"I really like this formula, which I purchased for help with insomnia - and it does help. But it was only after I got this that I realized just how many amazing things this plant does - from helping to reduce menopause issues, lowering blood pressure and reducing anxiety, to reducing inflammation, insulin levels and anxiety. "
53,5222,2024-09-05,Good ,"Love the brand,great ingredients with non alcohol,but not helpful for me with sleeping "
54,5222,2023-09-23,Quick stress relieve,"Calms the nerves in the stomach within 10 minutes. Verry efficient extract, when dropped into a glass of water the alcohol does not taste to heavy,. Give nice dreams when taken before bed. In the daytime you don t fall asleep nor get drowsiness from this product. When taken in higher dos, two pipets it is an anxiety reliever
"
55,5222,2023-08-26,,"Ordered this alcohol-free fluid extract of Passionflower as an aid for my nervous system to use it in very stressful periods, having difficulties with falling asleep. 
If to take these drops in a course, they really calm down my nerves and make falling asleep much easier.
I love that this product is much better abd healthier, if you avoid getting into addiction."
56,5222,2023-07-12,The best!,"Years ago, I was looking for a non-alcoholic sleep aid with no side effects and was recommended to this product by my herbalist. I still take about 4 droppers pretty much every night and it works!  Passionflower makes me sleep deeper and relaxes me. Love love love this product!"
57,5222,2023-06-15,,"As an aid for anxiety, the passionflower supplement proved to be quite effective for me. Passionflower contains compounds that interact with the brain's receptors, potentially reducing anxiety symptoms. After incorporating passionflower into my routine, I noticed a noticeable reduction in anxiety levels and a greater sense of calmness throughout the day. It helped me manage stress and maintain a more balanced state of mind.

Moreover, passionflower extract also acted as a natural sleep aid. By taking the supplement before bedtime, I experienced improved sleep quality and found it easier to fall asleep. The calming properties of passionflower helped quiet my mind and relax my body, allowing me to drift into a restful slumber. It was a welcome alternative to traditional sleep aids, as it felt gentler and more in harmony with my body's natural rhythms.

The passionflower supplement I used came in a convenient dropper form, which made it easy to measure and administer the desired dosage. The dropper allowed for precise control, ensuring I could adjust the amount according to my needs. I appreciated the flexibility it offered in tailoring the dosage to find the right balance for me."
58,5222,2023-05-30,,"I have found passionflower to be a great alternative to melatonin for improving my sleep. In fact, I‚Äôve had some nights where my sleep was even better than when I took melatonin. Additionally, I recently learned that passionflower has anti-inflammatory effects and may help relieve pain, which makes it an even more worthwhile product to try. If you‚Äôve experienced undesirable effects from melatonin, I highly recommend giving passionflower a chance.

59,5222,2023-05-06,," have been using Passionflower Aerial Parts for a few weeks now and I have noticed a significant improvement in my sleep quality.

Packaging and shipping time is very good. I'll be buying tinctures from this company from now on instead of alcohol based. I hope you will always have them in stock, and I mean not just Passionflower but also Valerian, Lemon Balm, Skullcap and all the herbs that help with sleep issues. I will also be looking for Mullein, Marshmallow and Licorice tinctures from this company."
64,5222,2023-03-02,Potent,"I feel the liquid works better than capsules, perhaps easier for my body to assimilate. More expensive per dose so if you take it regularly it can be taken into account. Tastes sweet and a bit bitter. My does is usually have the dropper but a full dropper works even better. Nice sleepy feeling. :-)"
65,5222,2022-11-15,,"
I bought this to help with sleep from time to time when I'm feeling a bit anxious before bed after hearing about passionflower on a podcast. I like this particular one as I like the quality of the Nature's Answer brand and was looking for an alcohol free passionflower extract that I can keep in my bedside table and take without water (just putting the drips under my tongue) if I decide to take it after I've already gone to bed. It's definitely gentle, but I think it works. Like all herbal extracts, I prefer not to use it daily but rather cycle it in and out and only use it when I need it as I feel it works better that way."
66,5222,2022-11-11,Occasional use for a deeper sleep,58yr old + perimenopausal. Sensitive on the sleep side of things. Good for me for occasional use.

I was no longer checking my symptoms as I normally do when anxiety is rearing its ugly head. I wouldn't say it makes me drowsy, just relaxed. I'm sure if I used more it would have a more drowsy effect. 15 drops works perfect for day time use! I love this stuff and I would buy again from iHerb. Amazing fast shipping and super low prices! "

I have trouble sleeping at night and have discovered a great way to help me with that problem. About an hour before going to bed I brew a nice cup of Chamomile tea and add the Passionflower extract to the tea brew. I have found that my sleep is deeper and longer now and most definitely attribute it to the combination above.

Appears to be a good quantity as I was able to sleep better without my brain constantly thinking."
238,5222,2022-01-22,,"This supplement is good overall. It has a pleasant taste to it, and it seems to work. Though, the price for quantity outweighs any benefits. In my opinion, valerian is probably a better choice."
239,5222,2022-01-05,,Just what I needed!  For me it helps my mood and also concentration and focus.  I love it in tincture form because it's easy to take.
240,5222,2021-12-08,,"Really helps me to fall asleep.  If I wake up again during the night and don't get right back to sleep, I take another dropper of this."
241,5222,2021-11-27,,Passionflower it's amazing to calm you down. I was so happy to find it here. Really good to calm you down from anxiety and panics.

246,5222,2023-06-12,,Great to help get to sleep faster but the taste was very strong. 
247,5222,2023-06-10,,It‚Äôs strong and has a powerful taste. I like it though. Seems to help with relaxation.

256,5222,2021-09-24,,"Great Passionflower Aerial Parts fluid extract! This supplement is an effective natural sedative. Passionflower extract also has a complex effect on the central nervous system, has a sedative, hypnotic, analytical, antispastic effect. Passion flower extract does not cause addiction and side effects, so it is safer than tranquilizers and barbiturates. Recommend! "
257,5222,2021-04-02,,It really works fast to help me go to sleep. I have fibromyalgia and don't sleep. Medication has too many side effects. This works fairly well most nights for about 5 hours sleep. Medication doesn't do any better and with this Passion Flower there are no side effects. üòÄ
258,5222,2012-09-28,Makes me sleepy and tastes okay,"I take various tinctures and most are awful because they taste of alcohol. This one, being alcohol free, does not, and just tastes a little bit sweet. It also makes me quite sleepy and so helps with falling back to sleep when I wake up during the night. It seems to work consistently, as well. I've found many natural sleep products only work for about one night, and then the next night they don't, so it's nice to find something I can take every night if I need it. Also, this company has a good 1:1 ratio of herbs to liquid which makes them quite potent."
259,5222,2009-05-25,One of the best sleep aids.,"This is my favorite sleep aid (and I've tried many at iHerb), in combination with Natrol Melatonin 3mg.  Many natural sleep aids give me a headache the next day, or a ""sleep hangover"".  Nature's Answer Passionflower extract gives me a pleasant sleep (with lots of dreams, it seems), and the next day I have no headache or sleep hangover.  I combine this with Natrol 3mg Melatonin (Natrol seems to release more slowly than some other brands, and therefore doesn't fizzle out after 4 or 5 hours like with some others)."
260,5222,2022-10-09,,"works for me as an adult, kiddo does not like the taste as hoping to help with anxiety, great that it's alcohol free, natural, ingredients good, quality good, "
261,5222,2022-03-10,,This passionflower aerial parts seems helping me feel relaxed and sleep better at night. I don't take it every day. I only take it when I was under some stress. 
262,5222,2022-02-25,,"It is ok .. but I'm not sure if it really boosts the mood .. have used it for only few times, not sure about the effect .. have not notices any effect in the few times I used it"
263,5222,2021-11-02,,I have had chronic insomnia for more then 10 years. I can notice a slight improvement but nothing spectacular yet. I'll keep taking it for a while to see.
264,5222,2021-11-02,,helps me control anxiety and depression. I don't need anxiolytics with this powerful plant
265,5222,2023-06-02,,"I saw some recommended for this product to help with insomnia. I tried it for two days, 2 ml each time as instructed and it did absolutely nothing to me. "
266,5222,2023-03-12,Didn't do anything for my insomnia,This may not be an accurate review based on the fact that Passionflower didn't seem to do anything for my insomnia. It might be a totally fine product for others.
267,5222,2023-02-09,"Nature's Answer, Passionflower Aerial Parts, Fluid Extract, Alcohol-Free, 2,000 mg, 1 fl oz (30 ml)","I took this to help with sleep. Although it is sedating, it caused my resperatory system to slow down.. Almost like there was pressure on my lungs. Also I experienced gum/tooth sensitivity both times after consuming these drops."
268,5222,2021-09-18,,"I am an anxious person. Thanks to Dr. Oz I have discovered this extract several years ago. I keep it in my bag. Having it at hand helps me calm down. 
Tastes great (I love it)
It is strong enough and you do not need a doctor's prescription.
if you like it üëç it"
269,5222,2021-08-02,Excellent for reducing stress,"This is an excellent product for when I feel that I've had too much work. It works pretty quickly and I notice that I might sleep a bit better on it as well. I will need to keep taking it to see if it works for a prolonged period of time. I think the taste of the medicine is not bad, just a bit strong! "
270,5222,2021-02-15,I love this stuff!  ,"Half a dropper of this is an excellent sleep aid, and it naturally tastes good!  I would never be without it.  When I first tried it during a particularly stressful period in my life I was amazed at its instant effect, and I could feel all of the wound up molecules in my body relax.  "
271,5222,2018-01-20,good product,I was about to lose faith in this company as I've tried many of their tinctures almost none working but this one actually work like a charm though in-order to notice the effect you need at a least a full squeeze/dropper under the tongue without liquid but be warned that the taste may be unpleasant or strong for some individuals and I'm one of them but it worth it; I wish iHerb offer more companies that produce alcohol-free tinctures.
272,5222,2010-04-26,,"I have been trying a few different brands of passion flower extract. So far this one taste better than the rest but not as strong. However, I might just been getting use to it at is not as strong as first time use. It does help me sleep a lot better."
273,5222,2021-02-11,Good ,I've been using this product recently for me and my dog (she loves it üê∂)  I didn't notice a huge difference but its still good alternative. I will purchase again ü•∞ the size is not enough I hope they have bigger ones... 
274,5222,2023-10-16,Can't feel much effects,I write for my pleasure sometimes so now Im a writer its another review that will be remembered by me
275,5222,2023-10-10,,"I bought drops to help me fall asleep. Maybe my expectations were higher, but it didn't really work."
276,5222,2023-06-03,Good ,This is a good quality tincture but it tastes pretty bad compared to other passionflower tinctures
277,5222,2023-02-07,Good,"We have just received this product, we will try it and come back to write a review."
278,5222,2023-01-26,Good,"Good product, tastes a bit earthy. Gave it three starts because it did not help me or my teen much with relaxing before sleep. "

280,5222,2022-11-13,,Did not use too many times  - guess it was all right. Not really sure.
281,5222,2022-10-20,,Tastes kind of bitter. I prefer the one form Herb Pharm even though it's more expensive. 
282,5222,2021-11-23,,Didn‚Äôt notice a huge difference with this product. It tastes very strong and herbally but great to have an alcohol free option. Please like if this was helpful to you :)
283,5222,2020-10-31,Good to use; sleep improved but not as much as taking a blend,"Tastes decently good. Easy enough to use but if any is spilled you will know about it - very dark-coloured liquid. Alcohol-free is a plus for health and for utility to anyone with a reason to avoid alcohol, and the glycerin used instead makes the taste far sweeter and more palatable than an alcohol tincture. Not sure whether I experienced any health effect but I know I was likely far too inconsistent in use to know. Some effect on sleep but did not improve to the same degree as with a multiple-nervine alcohol tincture."
284,5222,2020-05-24,Zen Feeling,"One of the few products that actually work against anxiety. I use more than adviced to get an effect and so the bottle is gone in a less than a week. But still, its worth it."

312,5222,2021-07-06,Calms me down day or night.,"My only issue with this product is that it's only 1oz. A 20z bottle would be more economical for me. This helps me with GAD and insomnia. For me, it as a long term alternative to benzodiazepine, which can only be used safely short term. "
313,5222,2021-04-28,Holy Grail,"I use passionflower extract to help me relax and fall asleep at night. I've used many different brands over the years, but this one is top-notch. I wish it came in a larger size! Will continue to repurchase. "
314,5222,2021-04-14,,"After trying a few brands, this is my favorite.  This one is not alcoholic like many others and the concentrated form required me to take less than half the dose of the leading alcohol-based brand.  I'm buying more today!!"
315,5222,2021-03-22,,I bought this on a promotion. I used to always eat the pill form which is good but very mild. This liquid version is definitely more potent and effective. The taste is also mild and pleasant.

321,5222,2019-12-27,Passionflower Extract,A few droppers (depending on the person) and I'm in a deep sleep with lots  of dreaming! Rested and energized the next day--non dependent so I can still sleep without it!
322,5222,2019-11-07,Amazing solid sleep,"No more waking at 3-4am, tossing frustratingly awake until the alarm goes. I then drag my exhausted self to work, feeling crap, not being as sharp or productive as l want to be."

329,5222,2022-08-21,So so,"I have PTSD and passionflower is recommended to calm nerves. It's fine, helps , very hard to quantify but no complaints either"
330,5222,2022-08-02,,its ok :D taste like a tree good combination with nice diet
331,5222,2021-11-07,,Very helpful as a muscle relaxant but on the pricey side.
332,5222,2021-07-25,,"Haven't really noticed much of a difference since using this two months ago. It helps calm me slightly but nothing much, I think this may have to do with the vagueness around dosage due to it being a liquid with a dropper. Not to mention the taste is AWFUL! I will be trying my luck with the pill version."

339,5222,2022-11-02,,"I got this hoping it's going to help with relaxation, unfortunately I finish the whole bottle and didn't see any changes. "
340,5222,2021-08-17,Seems to Help,"Started taking this to help improve poor sleep due to some recent stressful events. Some nights I sleep better than others since starting this, but it hasn't been consistent. It definitely has a strong taste, but not intolerable. I take it under my tongue followed with some water. "
341,5222,2021-07-03,Suprisingly good!,"I was pleasantly suprised at how gently calming these are, as I have used prescription anxiety meds for years. Takes the edge off without being sleepy sedating. Good for nighttime anxiety."
342,5222,2021-06-29,,It helps good night sleep but it is a bit hard to find a proper amount of use for me. The recommended amount per use is a bit strong for me.
343,5222,2021-02-20,,We have been taking this flaxseed softgel for many years and found it to be good as compared with other brands. The price from iHerbs is also lower and reasonable.
344,5222,2021-02-07,,I put drops as prescribed  in my tea in the evening about 1 hrs before I want to sleeps and it gives a feeling of calmness which helps to fall asleep much easier. However for serious insomnia this is not the solution. 
345,5222,2021-01-29,,"My sleep aid, herbal essence is so safe to use. It calm your nervous system and mind to promote deep sleep. I usually take few drops under tongue before sleep. No drowsiness. Recommend. "
346,5222,2017-10-28,Works,",i use about 10 drops usually and it relaxes and allows me to fall asleep if my mind is unable to wind down. But it seems to be strong on the stomach and I must eat something after taking it everytime"
347,5222,2016-10-16,Helps In Claming,It helps in calming the body and mind. Ideally the environment also should not be too noisy. I usually use 30 to 40 drops and it seems to take effect.
348,5222,2020-12-10,Excellent! Love it ,This really does help sleep come upon you. And you don't feel heavy eyed the next morning.

Then a very stressful situation occurred, and I decided to try it. I took less than what was indicated on the bottle. The effect came within ten minutes. Very calming! I didn‚Äôt even expect this, to be honest. Now passionflower is a priority for me and my clients"
502,5222,2024-01-24,Super soothing,"I will be ordering this passionflower for the second time. When I bought it for the first time, I was skeptical. But the effect is Wow!!! I bought it based on the reviews, the quality is great!!! I also like the taste, I don't feel the taste of alcohol like other sedatives. Already after the 1st week, I saw an improvement, it became easier to fall asleep and sleep (those who live in Ukraine will understand). The package is 30 ml, it is enough for about a month.

504,5222,2024-09-22,delicious,"I bought this because I heard it would improve the quality of my sleep. I always put it in lukewarm water and drink it a few hours before going to bed. It's not that big, but you can only put in one push with the dropper, so it seems like it will last quite a while."
505,5222,2024-05-29,Sleep better,"I was looking for passionflower flower essence. My whole family drinks it, and everyone is sleeping soundly. I used to be unable to fall asleep even when lying down, but now everyone sleeps soundly. I can't live without it. I put 4 drops in my drink in the morning and evening and drink it."
506,5222,2024-09-16,,"I knew that many people buy it as a substitute for CBD, so I tried it out and it had a much more relaxing effect than I expected, and I wanted to lie down right away. It doesn't have a bad taste and is a generous size. I think it's the best remedy for inducing sleep."
507,5222,2024-07-13,,"I bought this because I saw many reviews saying it helps you sleep soundly. I drink it before going to bed, but I still wake up in the middle of the night. I'm trying various things, such as diluting it with water or putting it directly on the back of my tongue."
508,5222,2024-06-06,I feel calmer,"I wouldn't say it's delicious, but I feel like it calms down my irritability and impulses by continuing to use it.

I plan to continue using it."
509,5222,2024-04-06,,"I definitely feel like my anxiety has calmed down. And I can now sleep. Since it's not a drug, I think it's safe to continue taking it, so I take a few drops under my tongue every day. I feel like it's working at night, but not in the morning or afternoon. Some people may not like the taste. I don't think the ingredients are very reassuring."

511,5222,2023-10-22,For pineal gland detox,"I heard that passionflower is good for detoxifying the pineal gland, so I had been taking it as an extract for a while. It is made with non-GMO natural ingredients and can be consumed with confidence. It's a bit disappointing that it's not organic. After that, I switched to a tablet. It seems to have a relaxing effect as well."

I also feel less tired. My period has also been delayed, so I guess my body is reacting to it!"
515,5222,2024-09-21,For dogs,"I bought this for my senior dog who has heart disease. I also give him dried herbs, but this has a stronger concentration, so I sprinkle it on his food as a supplement. The good thing about tinctures for dogs is that they are often sweet-tasting, so they are easy to use and dogs don't dislike them. I think the quality is good, and the size is just right to use it up before it goes bad. I also appreciate that it doesn't contain alcohol."

Shortly after getting into bed, I fell asleep. I tried various timings to drink, but it felt good to drink 30 minutes before going to bed. If you take it the night before, you will feel calm during the next day. I forgot to take it the day before when I thought I was getting irritated, so it seems to be working for me.

But I want to share my experience: insomnia that does not go away with conventional sedative drugs will always have a different cause. It was intoxication for me. I picked up the right vitamin - sleep returned from the first pill. Before this, I tried polyherba sedatives, all to no avail, because they do not work with the cause. I didn‚Äôt take melatonin, because I think that it goes too deep into the hormonal balance, up to the regulation of sex hormones. Andrew Huberman does not advise (google who it is)."

I put 10 drops of passionflower and 2 drops of valerian, and I drank and slept with my husband and wife 30 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime. My husband and I are now able to sleep deeply and I really like it. It's easier and recommended than herbal tea without worrying about the toilet. Is it okay to inoculate directly? I can sleep well, so I think the ingredients are perfect. I used to take sleep-onsets, but thanks to the encounter with Valerian, I no longer need them, which is a great help. Unlike sleep-onsets, it is naturally derived, does not awaken halfway, and stays sound until morning, which is very helpful. I haven't tried Passion Flower alone, so I'll try it next time. The price can be cheap."

It has a scent of herbs. If you are aiming for a natural sleep, please try this one first. There is also chamomile, which is also recommended, but when I can't sleep lately, this one works better."
866,5222,2022-05-05,,"It was very good! The taste was like prunes and I didn't dislike it at all. When I put water in my mouth and swallowed it with a single dropper, I didn't mind the taste and smell. The effect was quick and I was relieved of the stress I was worried about and I couldn't think about anything. I don't feel sleepy, so I think it's easy to use during the day. The only unfortunate thing is that the cost performance is not good."

For a long time, neither valerian nor motherwort have helped. I drank noofen and gidazepam, but started having liver problems. I was looking for a herbal version of a sedative that could help and found it. In the beginning, it generally acted strongly, now, apparently, the body is a little used to it, but it still helps to calm down, and in the evening, along with melatonin, to fall asleep. I also give a daughter who feeds a baby under stress, on the site e-lactation of passionflower is allowed for nursing mothers. So I definitely recommend it as a mild, but working sedative and at the same time not harmful to the body. I have already ordered the 5th bottle. It is a pity that the volume is too small."

The action is very mild, acts quickly, does not affect the speed and mental nature, you just watch everything that happens from the side, as if it was happening to you.

1093,5222,2019-06-28,Mild Soothing Effect,"Very soft acting. This medicine has a cumulative effect, like valerian, so the effect may not come immediately, but I immediately felt twenty minutes after the first dose, as the relaxation came, calm. I have severe insomnia, I began to sleep soundly with passiflora, I no longer wake up at night, my sleep has become deep, I started to get enough sleep. One minus, a bottle lasts days for 10-12, if you drink three times a day, 2 pipettes (this is the maximum recommended dosage. The minimum one pipette). The taste is light, special if diluted in a large amount of water."

1095,5222,2018-11-16,"Effective, especially if used correctly","Great working passionflower! There is something to compare, I bought valerian in different forms, and another passiflora, incl. in capsules, this one turned out to be the most effective. Under stress, pour a rather incomplete pipette under the tongue and not immediately swallow, but hold for at least a minute, so it starts to act much faster. It tastes very sweet. I always carry in my purse with me, it doesn‚Äôt take up space, but it has rescued me more than once."
1096,5222,2021-07-15,"Has a cumulative effect, the miracle does not happen immediately","I am constantly in search of a means to improve the quality of sleep, which is not addictive and does not bag after sleep. When this tool with such a high score caught my eye, there could be no other way. The Maya and Aztecs knew about the calming and relaxing effect of passionflower on the nervous system. They have used it since time immemorial as a medicinal plant. Currently, passionflower preparations are used for neuro-vegetative dystonia, states of fear, anxiety and nervousness. In case of cardiovascular diseases, the use of passionflower together with hawthorn is effective. At first impressions, everything is super. Tincture without alcohol in solid dark glass, with a convenient pipette dispenser. Feels like a pleasant liquid with the smell and taste of burnt caramel, the water colors in the color of black tea. I add 1-2 pipettes to a small amount of water half an hour to an hour before bed. If you have time and desire, you can brew a bag of chamomile, wait until the broth cools down and add passionflower. It turns out a delicious herbal tea (for chamomile lovers). The effect does not come instantly, you need to wait at least an hour. At the beginning of the course, the effect was very weak, there was a calming effect, but it did not affect sleep. The result became noticeable 2 weeks after application, already finishing the bottle. Apparently, there is a cumulative effect. Of the minuses, I note - uneconomical expense. In a bottle of 30 ml, the recommended dose is 1-2 ml (74 drops) three times a day. That is, the maximum can be stretched for 10 days if you drink according to this scheme (and at a minimum dose of 1 ml)."

There is no depression or depression, I don‚Äôt wake up in the middle of the night (I sleep until the morning), that is, the main goal is to speed up the process of falling asleep. After seeing good reviews, I decided to try passionflower. I like Nature's Answer products because of their good natural composition, and the liquid form allows for better absorption. The only thing, as usual, I have a complaint about the pipette dispenser and recommendations: counting 70 drops is not very convenient every time, it‚Äôs easier to count the drops into pipettes. In addition, for some reason it is problematic to draw a full pipette at a time - only half is typed. In general, I stopped at a dosage of 2-3 ""half a pipette"". Initially, I diluted the solution in water, but the taste of passionflower is quite specific, so I switched to juice or fruit drink, which mask this taste. From one-time receptions, the effect was not noticed at all. When taken on an ongoing basis, there were slight improvements, as it seemed to me, but somehow unstable - you immediately fall asleep, then as usual. Given the cost of a jar and the manufacturer's recommendations, $ 10 for 2 weeks is somehow not very profitable. I decided to switch to liquid magnesium (CALM) and I see a better effect, moreover, this is a more profitable option for the price."
