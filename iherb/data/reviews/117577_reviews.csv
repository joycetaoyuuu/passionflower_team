0,117577,2023-11-25,Bought for help with sleep but prefer Valerian,Bought for help with sleep but I prefer Valerian. It is  a good quality product and I like that it is the whole plant with no added ingredients and not a processed extract (full spectrum). I read books on herbalism and I understand it is safer to take the whole plant and not a concentrated extract. I take this for menopausal sleep disruption and I find that it helps. It is mildly sedating. However herbalists recommend you don't take this if you also have low mood as it can be mood lowering. I find Swanson to be excellent quality and value. Excellent service from iherb as always - good value and super fast careful delivery.

The packaging is sturdy and practical, ensuring the product remains fresh. I also appreciate that there are detailed usage instructions, which are easy to follow. This supplement has definitely met my expectations and I've had a consistent experience with its effectiveness. Ordering through iHerb was a breeze as usual, with the product arriving on time and in perfect condition. The customer service is commendable, providing peace of mind with their supportive and responsive approach. For anyone considering this product, I recommend giving it a try. It‚Äôs a reliable choice that supports a healthy lifestyle. Remember to consult with a healthcare provider to ensure it fits your specific health needs."

31,117577,2023-11-25,,"When I think of pop, the only thing that comes to mind is beer, but I bought this because it was said to have great effects. The capsules are easy to swallow, but it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. I think it can't be helped because it's a component of beer lol. Due to my age, I have been having trouble sleeping. I was taking GABA and glycine, but when I added pop, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night and fell asleep for the first time in a while. The quality is excellent. I only took one pill at night, but I think I'll try taking it in the morning as well to relieve stress. It's better for dieting than drinking a lot of beer and getting drunk, so I keep coming back."
