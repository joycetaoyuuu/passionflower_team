2,122153,2023-12-08,Great product,"My dog loves them. She gets calm but not blunt. Especially they are great for small dogs because every bite contains just almost 2 mg of tryptophan, so it's easy to measure. My dog weighs 6 kg and I give her 1 in the morning, 1 in the afternoon and one by night. For a smaller dog they will be easy to cut in half. My dog get stressed because of a neighbours dog barking when left alone, and that made my dog bark when left alone, but with these treats she is calm and relaxed when left alone."
