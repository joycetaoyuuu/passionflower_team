0,1344,2024-01-03,Excellent,"This is a game changer! This product deserves a solid five star rating for delivering on its promise of improved sleep quality. From the first night, I experienced quicker, uninterrupted sleep. No grogginess the next day which is great! Not only has my sleep improved, but my energy levels and mood have, too. Grateful for the restful nights. "
1,1344,2024-09-27,,"Source Naturals Sleep Science NutraSleep has been an effective aid for improving my sleep quality, helping me drift off faster and enjoy a more restful night. I appreciate that it combines natural ingredients like melatonin and calming herbs, which work synergistically to promote relaxation without the grogginess that sometimes comes with other sleep aids. The tablets are easy to swallow, and I’ve noticed a significant difference in how refreshed I feel upon waking. Overall, it’s a reliable option for anyone looking to enhance their sleep routine naturally and wake up feeling rejuvenated.

2,1344,2024-06-23,Great sleep,"My sister told me about this product because I have trouble sleeping and falling asleep. As soon as I take it, I stop feeling drowsy and I’m able to go to sleep much faster and when I wake up to use the restroom, I’m able to go to sleep again sooner."
3,1344,2024-02-25,Best All In One Sleeping Supplement!,"I've tried a lot of different sleeping supplements before, but none are as comprehensive or as potent as the ones in NutraSleep. 

- The tablet is large which accommodates greater potency.
- My sleep is deeper because of this supplement

I would highly recommend this to anyone with problematic sleep who is looking for an all in one solution. "
4,1344,2024-09-07,OK,I am a postmenopausal woman who has insomnia. I am taking this with Valerian Extract Forte and Calcium Magnesium. I can have reasonably good sleep and rest. I prefer NightRest as it does not give me any groggy feelings the next day.
5,1344,2024-01-05,Good,"Bought this product for my mom, she has trouble sleeping and wakes up frequently, and she says these pills have improved her sleep. Good composition, I recommend it."
6,1344,2023-11-30,Nightly Ritual!!! ,"I used to take Rx meds for sleep, but was awakened to natural healing some years ago. I've taken these every night for several years & love them!!!"
7,1344,2023-10-31,Good suplement,"It helps to sleep longer and deeper, without waking up. I also noticed much less need to go to the toilet during the sleep time.
"
8,1344,2024-08-20,good when you need,"the quality is good, size is also good, no specially taste and the ingredient should be nice and benefit to take everyday i think  the dosage is appropriate as well. when i travel to US or Europe, this is very helpful for my sleep"
9,1344,2024-06-12,Прекрасно!,"Thank you very much for this product, it suited me, I like the packaging, comfortable and stylish, I will order more of these products, and recommend them to all my friends and relatives! good!!
"
10,1344,2024-03-22,verified customer,excellent product and combination of ingredients!  I found that it calms the mind and induces sleep.  I need more than 1 and I take additional supplements with this.
11,1344,2024-02-26,Natural ingredients for sleeping,"I was tired - pun intended - of taking sleep meds, so I looked for natural alternatives.  This has a good dose of natural ingredients to aid with falling and staying asleep "
12,1344,2024-01-29,,"It is a unique blend of natural ingredients containing vitamins, minerals, herbs, taurine and the neurotransmitter GABA, which are known to have a relaxing and calming effect."
13,1344,2024-02-22,Sleep support ,"These worked OK for me as a sleep complex but I wish they had higher quantities of certain, such as more valerian root, and if they would have any melatonin inside them. I am a very poor sleeper, so if you are not that bad of a sleeper, these can be quite helpful for you. They are a little bit on the big side and they do smell. They seem much less addictive than prescription sleep tablets. "
14,1344,2024-07-16,Fine,"Generally, it's good but IDK, maybe it's just me but if I take these pills and won't fall asleep within the first half an hour after, that's it. I won't sleep the night "
15,1344,2023-05-16,,"Pluses: it has no after taste and one tablet has a small amount of GABA so you can take the amount you need (one serving is 2 tablets, but I needed at least 5-6 tablets to fall asleep). Also, it has Magnesium and Calcium which is a plus for me! 
Minuses: Hard to swallow, has only100 tablets (so if you need more that 2 a night, it doesn't last for long, hence it's quite expensive)."
16,1344,2023-02-24,,"I take this sleep aid every night and it’s really effective for me as long as I am conscious of my intake and timing of other foods and supplements.  It has several effective ingredients that are safe and helpful in over all health too. It is rather large so I have to chew it with a flavored lozenge, so I would love it if they would make a citrus flavored one. "
17,1344,2024-05-15,May help with sleep,"This formula seems to have all the right ingredients to help with sleep, but the giant tablets make is difficult to swallow for me. Since the dosage is multiple pills, this makes it hard for me to want to take it each night. "
18,1344,2023-10-12,Love this,"I bought this for my mom, a friend and now myself. I really like that it doesn't have melatonin in it. Make sure to take it early so that you aren't groggy in the morning but helps me really sleep through the night. "
19,1344,2023-07-01,effective,"I've used this often over the years. It's effective, and it doesn't have melatonin, which gives me bad dreams. NutraSleep doesn't leave an effect the next day. That's for me. It may affect others differently. Check all the reviews. "
20,1344,2024-03-20,Great for sleep,I take these before bedtime and really feel a difference in sleep quality. Comes recommended.
21,1344,2024-09-14,,"great product

22,1344,2023-09-11,,"Awesome product for sleeping,  covers extra chatter in mind, wake up peaceful and don't need to consume but one or the recommended dosage "
23,1344,2023-09-08,helps,"it s not much, but that tiny lil bit helps me fall asleep. amazing"

27,1344,2023-08-21,,helps me to sleep! but size of tablet quite large and hard to swallow 
28,1344,2023-07-23,Helps me sleep,"I love this brand, good quality product and ingredients.

30,1344,2023-07-19,Прекрасно!,"A good additive, excellent packaging, as well as a nice price, I recommend buying!)"
31,1344,2023-07-11,,I used to get this with melatonin in australia but o available here in UK and this is still really good for sleep. 
32,1344,2023-06-20,,"It doesn't make me sleep, but I wake up better rested."
33,1344,2023-06-04,,"Great value and good effect, I use this item often. Quality is great"
34,1344,2023-05-05,,"Im in love with this supplement. I fell better afther one month of using it, and my mood and health has big improvement."
35,1344,2022-11-12,,Love these. Have tried many brands and these work really well 
36,1344,2023-12-30,Did not help much,Not My favourit for sleep. Did not help me much. I can not recommend this
37,1344,2022-04-11,,I saved me every night even when I had some strong coffee. I love the fact it's natural ingredient and so does not create strong reliance on it. 
38,1344,2022-03-17,,These pills have changed my life. They help me fall asleep and stay asleep. They are more effective than expected. Great product. One con is that the pills are rather large to swallow.
39,1344,2022-03-14,Very good choice,"These pills have changed my life. They help me fall asleep and stay asleep. They are more effective than expected. Great product. One con is that the pills are rather large to swallow.
"
40,1344,2022-03-10,Excellent product,These pills have changed my life. They help me fall asleep and stay asleep. They are more effective than expected. Great product. One con is that the pills are rather large to swallow.
41,1344,2023-08-14,,i like it but take in advnce that the pills are big.
42,1344,2022-12-20,好的,is a good product and let my body get healthy more
43,1344,2021-12-22,,"Normaly i use the Source Naturals, Serene Science, Theanine Serene but these where sold out at that moment. Nutra sleep works also well, although I have to take 3 tablets to feel the effect. "
44,1344,2009-11-13,Gentle sleep aid,"If I wake in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep, I take two of these and in about half an hour, I am sleepy.  They are not overly strong, but they are just enough to get the job done."
45,1344,2021-11-26,Two bonuses,"between all the supplements that I alternate to fall in a sleep again when I wake up in the middle of the nite this is a good one, it helps me to relax and since it contains a lot of magnesium it helps me to go to the toilet too, two bonuses"
46,1344,2013-03-08,very good choice,"I can just recommend those tabletts
I finally found some without chemicals and they work. I just take one and go to bed and have a good sleep with good dreams. I don't wake up every hour and noise. I might get up ones to go to the toilet. The tabletts are not strong but help me without feeling bad taking them."
47,1344,2023-09-05,אישור,Really great product for making you fall a sleep faster overall I recommend this one 
48,1344,2022-02-20,nutrasleep,"i suffer from insomnia, these help a little combined  with other ingredients."
49,1344,2019-08-04,Total game changer,"Take 7-8 of these before bed and sleep like a baby. Both rem and deep sleep have improved where other supplements like GABA, inositol, taurine, magnesium have not been so effective in isolation. This blend seems to do it for me. Definitely a fan."
50,1344,2017-04-16,Excellent product!,"I've been using NutraSleep for a couple of years and am so satisfied - I can't imagine heading to bed without two caplets one hour before retiring. It's a must-have in my arsenal.  Along with Source Naturals 5-HTP, I sleep very well!"
51,1344,2015-01-03,Effective without side effects,"I take only one at bedtime and sleep like a baby. This stuff makes the difference between a marginal nightrest of six hrs of sleep and a good nightrest of at least eight hrs. No nightmares, drowsiness or other side effects."
52,1344,2012-09-24,Valerian & GABA,"The combination of ingredients work well together for me.  I also take them with tryptophan.  Even if I don't sleep I'm relaxed which is just as important.

I recommend doing the research on the ingredients & watch the interaction with anti-depressants."
53,1344,2012-06-25,One of my primary sleep supplements,"Since one supplement does not do the job of getting me to sleep and keeping me asleep, I use several including a low dose prescriptive (1/4 tab trazadone).  NutraSleep has been one of my main supplements for a few months and have combined it with other other stronger valerian combinations as well as melatonin sprays and GABA sublingual tabs. I think the nutrients in this supplement have an overall benefit to sleep quality."
54,1344,2011-01-08,excellent! ,"i dropped off within 30 minutes of taking these and i sleep very well with no groggies in the morning, excellent quality and price, i've been taking source naturals since the early 90's and love them..  "
55,1344,2021-09-14,Good to try,"I take 1 capsule with Melatonin 3mg, very comfort feeling when wake up in the morning and fell a sleep shortly even awake  in the middle of night. Quality of sleep is better than only with Melatonin. "
56,1344,2022-06-09,, I have found this product very good for a restful sleep without a hangover side effect. 
57,1344,2021-11-04,Great product,Helps me to get to sleep fast and can better sustain my sleep than melatonin.
58,1344,2014-03-07,No sleep,I have a very hard time getting to sleep or staying to sleep. Sometimes this works for me and sometimes not. I does seem to help let me get back to sleep when I wake during the night. 
59,1344,2008-02-26,Nothing else like it,"I use it for Periodic Limb Movement Disorder. It seems to be the only thing on the market with Magnesium, Taurine and Valerien Good price, too."
60,1344,2022-08-19,Ok,I love the combinations of ingredients in this product; but it wasn't enough to take care of my specific sleep issues. 
61,1344,2022-03-15,,Quite big pill to swallow. I took 2 pills with Melatonin. And I can sleep. 
62,1344,2023-06-15,מתחת לממוצע ,Nothing special disappointed hardly any sleep effect good ingredients but in small amounts need too many per night 
63,1344,2021-08-29,,"This has been one of my favorite sleep aides for many years.  However, I had to find others when it went out of stock.  I don't know if my sleep has gotten worse or if it's less effective than it used to be for me."
64,1344,2006-08-02,Definitely helps!,"I'm a poor sleeper, I wouldn't say an insomniac, but occasional trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. This product is very helpful and a great natural alternative to prescription sleep aids."
65,1344,2010-10-23,Ok product,"I'm not sure about this yet, it seems to help a little with sleep when mixed with something else, but i think its not strong enough on its own. The tablets are quite large & 4 are recommended. Its also got GABA & other calming herbs, good for anxiety."
66,1344,2008-10-20,Sweet dreams,"Gave a bottle to my sister who suffers from insomia. She gave feedback that it works, but was not sure whether it gave her a slight headache as well."
67,1344,2021-05-02,,enjoy this product alot. relaxes you for a good night's sleep
68,1344,2017-04-23,Gentle and Effective ,Great for early risers and those who can't tolerate melatonin. I take 3-4 tablets and feel refreshed next day.
69,1344,2012-04-25,I'm sleeping so much better!,I take four of these about 30 minutes before going to sleep.  I am a light sleeper.  These are keeping me asleep much better.
70,1344,2010-01-31,Sleep without hangover,Adjustable dosing for a restful night's sleep.  No hangover in the morning when you have to be alert for work.
71,1344,2009-03-25,Can't sleep without them,Really effective! Can't sleep without taking them at night.
72,1344,2007-10-10,Favorite sleep and anti-anxiety product,"Great product - quick absorption, no morning dreariness, no need to consume lots of liquids when taking these tablets"
73,1344,2022-08-15,Love!,Excellent product. Great quality. Works as described. Love
74,1344,2022-07-10,,great product! fully corresponds to the description!
75,1344,2021-03-29,,This product is really great - it is a shame it hasn't been available to purchase for a while.  Worked really well and no groggy feel in the morning
76,1344,2020-10-28,,My second bottle. I have insomnia and this product works well for me.
77,1344,2017-09-29,Great results for nonessetial tremors,"I have a family member that started using this for non essential tremors.  The results were fantastic without any noted side effects. 
"
78,1344,2013-09-17,Work,"The amount of magnesium in these tablets is what really does trick.

1.2g of magnesium"
79,1344,2022-06-24,,Great product to promote sleep
80,1344,2012-06-02,,"I like these, they are a bit big and can be difficult to swallow the recommended 4 tablets, but i mix these with other herbs & only take 2 at night. They have GABA in them to help relax."
81,1344,2008-02-04,does work quite well,"Not perfect, but I noticed a significant improvement in my sleep patterns."
82,1344,2016-10-24,Great to help you get to sleep,Best natural product I have used
83,1344,2021-01-06,,"This works so well for me.

85,1344,2012-09-22,                                             Nourishing Sleep Aid,Good sleep aid. Good price.
86,1344,2011-01-09,big tablets,Good product but annoyingly big tablets
87,1344,2021-08-20,Прекрасно!,👍
88,1344,2021-01-26,低於平均值,The pill is huge and i do not sleep well 
89,1344,2012-06-16,great,  Vey good product.
90,1344,2011-03-29,relaxing,"helps sleep
"
91,1344,2009-03-06,NutraSleep,"I have trouble sleeping, and still need to take NYQUIL at night, so don't know if this is helping."
92,1344,2021-05-22,,This didn't work for me.
93,1344,2021-03-14,,Sleep fast
94,1344,2021-03-23,,No use for me! 
95,1344,2024-04-17,Sleep Enhancement,"I used to buy night rest, but it can’t be shipped to Taiwan at the moment, so I switched to this one as an alternative. My mother has long-term sleep disorders and relies on sleeping pills, but the more she eats, the heavier she gets. After taking health food to aid sleep, the number of sleeping pills can be reduced. Therefore, I choose to continue buying sleep-aid health foods to reduce dependence on sleeping pills."
96,1344,2023-11-15,NightRest and comparison review,"It doesn't contain melatonin like NightRest, but instead contains niacin, calcium, inositol, and valerian root (also known as valerian). Also, while NightRest says 2 tablets per serving, this NutraSleep says 4 tablets per serving. And some products are set to take a larger amount of the same ingredient. I felt the sleep effect was better with NightRest, but NatraSleep was less likely to linger on the next day. I prefer NightRest, but it's better than nothing."
97,1344,2024-09-17,Improved insomnia,"I have had insomnia symptoms for several years. Because I don’t want to use sleeping pills for a long time, I bought it and tried it. The effect was very slow in the first 3 days and it took a few hours before I started to feel sleepy. But after the fourth day, my body has improved my sleepiness. I am very happy. I can use some help to replace sleeping pills...it's just that the particles are very big (I can take them in half, but it doesn't have any effect). Thank you."
98,1344,2024-09-15,Improved sleep quality," I don't have a big sleep problem, so my goal is to choose something with GABA but no melatonin, because I'm worried that my body will rely on external melatonin. This one fits my requirements perfectly. Take it when needed, but on days when you are in better condition, it won’t cause insomnia if you don’t take it, and I feel very safe. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to swallow"
99,1344,2024-03-10,very pleased,"A good size, 100 pills, should be enough for about a month and a half. I took a dose of 2 pills, I enjoyed almost continuous sleep (I only woke up once). No taste, a little big ball, but you can manage. So far very satisfied, the best natural sleep aid I've tried. "
100,1344,2023-11-25,Good after sleeping,"Rather than saying it helps me fall asleep better, I get the impression that I don't wake up after sleeping. Rather than forcefully inducing sleepiness, if you take a supplement, turn off the light, and close your eyes, you'll be asleep before you know it, and you won't feel like you're waking up while you're sleeping. I recommend it to people who want to sleep without straining themselves."
101,1344,2024-09-03,I ordered this because I have insomnia.,"I bought it after looking at the ingredients, and the quality is good. It’s easy to swallow, so it’s not burdensome. I took it before bed, and it definitely works. I’m going to take it from now on when I can’t sleep."
102,1344,2024-04-27,,"I'm not sure about taurine, but the rest of the ingredients are ingredients that help you fall asleep easily by creating a stable mood before sleep. It's a good product"
103,1344,2024-04-18,To make it easier to wake up in the morning,"The size of each pill is large, but I'm used to taking supplements from overseas, so it's not a problem. It reduced my morning fatigue."
104,1344,2024-03-31,no melatonin,"Although melatonin is not unsafe, it is an ingredient that has a large effect, so I am grateful for this collection of ingredients that support sleep other than melatonin."
105,1344,2023-11-27,,"It is a unique blend of natural ingredients containing vitamins, minerals, herbs, taurine and the neurotransmitter GABA, which are known to have relaxing and calming effects."
106,1344,2024-09-11,,I give it 3 stars because I'm just starting to take it and I don't know if it works or not. I want to think so. I'm taking two but I read several reviews that say it works so that's the only reason I bought it. 
107,1344,2024-07-23,Confusing,"The packaging is similar to Nightrest so I bought it by mistake, so be careful not to make a mistake when buying it. The amount you drink is large so I think it's too much to drink at night before going to bed, so I'll go back to Nightrest after I've finished it."
108,1344,2024-08-10,I bought it hoping for good results.,"I bought this because I was having trouble sleeping well, and although it didn't make it any easier to fall asleep, I'm glad it's from a high-quality, safe brand."
109,1344,2023-12-26,very good! Nice product PD,It tastes good and is authentic. I will continue to buy it. The portion is full.
110,1344,2023-11-10,amazing,The quality is excellent and the collagen components are more beneficial. The product suits me the most
111,1344,2023-09-25,Is good!,"I also bought and tried Melatonin from Natural Sleep, but this seemed to work better for me. I have been able to wake up refreshed the morning after taking it! Recommended. However, the tablets are large, so I crush them before taking them. I would appreciate it if it could be made a little smaller."
112,1344,2023-05-31,At first I thought it was a spitting thing...but!,"I woke up many times in the middle of the night, so I wanted to improve the quality of my sleep, but I haven't felt the effects of sleeping supplements sold in Japan. I didn't believe much either. But if you just take one tablet, it's morning! ! I was surprised that there was such a thing. Even if I wake up in the middle of the night, I can go back to sleep right away. The other day, I bought one with melatonin because it was out of stock, so I'd like to compare how I drank it with this one. By the way, it doesn't smell good (laughs)."
113,1344,2023-01-01,,"My husband keeps waking up from his sleep and even when he wakes up, he's tired, so I started feeding him. There is no problem waking up in the morning. It's a bit large, so I can't eat it before I can't swallow pills well, but I've tried splitting it occasionally and the quality and ingredients are very good."
114,1344,2024-01-12,Fall asleep gently,Contains natural ingredients to help you fall asleep gently. I feel refreshed when I wake up the next morning.
115,1344,2024-06-16,okay,"excellent! Support me with a like, my only source of livelihood. A well-known product that is distinguished by its quality, composition, and healthy and beneficial ingredients. "
116,1344,2024-06-11,Average,"I bought it to improve sleep, but the drug invigorates me ((((perhaps not all ingredients are suitable for me for sleep. They are experimenting further)"
117,1344,2024-10-13,Menopausal insomnia,"If you eat 4, you can sleep soundly for two hours."
118,1344,2024-09-24,,The tablets are large and need to be crushed before taking.
119,1344,2024-09-23,Great,"High quality, proven ingredients, convenient size, reliable packaging, undeniable benefits, neutral taste, I recommend to everyone "
120,1344,2024-09-12,,Helps to sleep well. I try not to get carried away. The quality is excellent. The dosage is normal. 
121,1344,2024-09-09,Excellent!,"Excellent additives, good quality, good price and good packaging, I recommend you to buy"
122,1344,2024-08-30,The price is reasonable and the effect is good. I would recommend this product.,The price is reasonable and the effect is good. I would recommend this product.
123,1344,2024-08-16,repeat,I bought it before and it was good so I bought it again!
124,1344,2024-07-01,,This product fully corresponds to the characteristics indicated on the packaging
125,1344,2024-06-23,Suppress irritation.,Taking it about an hour before going to sleep helps reduce irritability and makes it easier to fall asleep.
126,1344,2024-04-28,,"Excellent quantity, excellent size, excellent taste, good smell, but the dosage is good
"
127,1344,2024-04-19,Excellent!,"It’s a good supplement, I take it every day, there are no side effects and the capsules are easy to swallow. "
128,1344,2024-03-06,"Honestly, I didn't feel any effect at all. ","It says to take 2 to 4 pills. It was my first time, so I took 2 pills. 1. Falling asleep and 2. Maintaining a sound sleep for a long time. It didn't help at all in two areas. I went to bed at 12, woke up at 3, and woke up suffering from insomnia.

179,1344,2014-03-20,Easy operation,"Bought as a sports supplement to recover better (floor - husband; weight - 86kg). Took (and drink) with Naturade, SlumberAid, Three-Stage Sleep Enhancer (tried to combine one to three tablets; together work better if you drink 2 of each). Peel 1, 2, 3 and 4 tablets. It works very easily, if distracted by something, you can lose the feeling of drowsiness (so you drink, lie down and try to sleep). Poorly aligned with caffeinated beverages (like Naturade, SlumberAid, Three-Stage Sleep Enhancer), it is better not to drink coffee / tea and so on. 5 hours before receiving the tablets, otherwise the effect is greatly reduced. Tablets are large, jar almost full (sometimes on the bottom, and the rest of wool). ps I think that Source Naturals, NightRest, with Melatonin would work better, but it ended when I bought it. If you found my review helpful - click Yes"

184,1344,2018-12-28,The best choice,"I order the second time. The first order was lying around for several years, because I tried it a couple of times and did not see the effect. After these few years, I tried again, and saw the effect. It simply does not make sense to expect an effect from him, as from a pharmacological sleeping pill, but it helps to sleep. I drink at night for 1 tablet. Ordered the second time, because it ends with a jar. This drug works better than a pair of valerian tablets, or Motherwort Forte, or Persen Forte. Novopassite contains an anxiolytic and is not safe. So the choice is not particularly great, and this drug from Ikherba is the best of all herbal hypnotics. Yes, and Melaksen is still harmful, and it was shown by the latest scientific research (and not advertising articles from the Internet). That, in general, is an obvious thing - one cannot use the basic governing biological system with impunity for a long time (day-night). Have a good sleep! :)"

RU Accept My husband and 1-2 tablets instead of the four, and it is enough to us: my husband, just to sleep tight, and helps me against my insomnia (of course, along with the observance of the regime).

For the time being, I drank one tablet and watched the situation, and increased it to two tablets, but I didn't feel much difference. So, for the time being, I'm taking this one tablet and GABA alone, although this supplement also contains GABA. I still wake up once or twice in the middle of the night, but during that time I feel like I'm sleeping well and deeply. Of particular note is the unique odor.

I read one of the reviews that it is good that there is no melatonin in the composition, as this is a hormone and it's scary to take it out of it! What kind of ignorance and ignorance of the latest scientific developments)))) melatonin is not the sex hormones that everyone is afraid to take. This is the recognized ""hormone of youth"", which is responsible not only for sleep, but also for immunity, the state of the cardiovascular system, the condition of the skin, etc. The most important is that after 30-35 years our body gradually ceases to produce this hormone at all! Therefore it is important to take it for everyone, especially women) In many foreign clinics of different countries it is prescribed for almost all patients with cardiovascular diseases, in doses of 10 mg or more.
