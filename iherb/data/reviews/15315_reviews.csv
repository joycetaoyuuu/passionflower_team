2,15315,2024-10-19,So far so good,"Honestly I’ve only used it a few times but I’ve liked it. I’ve taken it before bedtime and nap time. I have felt a subtle sense of relaxation.  Like with most herbal products. I imagine the more you take it, the more you’ll benefit from it. "
3,15315,2024-09-17,Ideal when i can't sleep,Herb pharm has very high quality ingredients.  I love this combination of herbs which always helps when i'm lying awake with insomnia.  Highly recommended.  
4,15315,2024-06-30,Helps ,Bought it to support my nervous system and help me sleep better.. I think that the quality of this herbal formula is excellent as the ingredients are organic. I take the recommended dosage in the water 3 times a day. Taste is ok.
5,15315,2024-06-18,,"If you have trouble with sleeping, this is your product indeed, it has great mix of ingredients and good quality. The size is not big comparing to the price, but it does the effect and has its benefits. The taste is not that bad, I mix it with water."

8,15315,2024-07-27,Sleep 😴 ,I had had terrible sleep problems for years. This was one product among many that helped me get by before I found out I had celiac and gave up gluten.  Now I sleep again. :) 
9,15315,2023-11-15,Good ,"It's pretty good, not exceptionally good to justify the price. I think it's overpriced. I need to use more than the bottle suggests to have any effect on me. So it becomes too expensive for me. "
10,15315,2023-06-29,"tastes terrible, works great ","I don't know which ingredient gives this its offensive taste, but it is essential to chase it with some water. However, it is 100% worth it, as it calms your mind and body in preparation for sleep. Every time I take this tincture, I wake up from solid sleep feeling incredibly refreshed.  "
11,15315,2022-12-02,Trouble sleeping?  Give this a try!,"I'm a big fan of anything Herb Pharm manufactures as the company grows a great many of the herbs they use, and sources everything else, carefully.  Like many, am experiencing trouble sleeping and have tried several other remedies, to no avail.  Have found by doubling the recommended dose (two droppers instead of one), drift off to dream land quickly and stay asleep for 6 to 7 hours.  Upon awakening, am bright eyed and ready to face another day.  "
12,15315,2024-10-17,Good I think,I have chronic insomnia so I try alot of products. This one was an experiment as I liked that it had no added nasties & some of the ingredients I'd had success with in the past. I'm still unsure if it works for me though 
13,15315,2024-06-16,Won’t solve all of your problems ,This is a nice natural alternative to help you relax into a good nights sleep. I think this works best when being consistent with it - but don’t count on this alone on fixing your sleep routine. 
14,15315,2024-01-30,it works okay for 3-4 hours,It puts me to sleep but only for 3-4 hours.  I need something stronger to get an 8 hour sleep and wake up feeling the difference.   Okay but not strong enough.  
15,15315,2024-01-05,,"This is very bitter, probably because of the alcohol and that makes it very unpleasant to take. So I don't, and not sure if it works as I really don't like the flavour. "
16,15315,2023-12-31,,"The taste is bitter 
This is my concern about this product 
Composition also bitter 
So I really don’t know what is the benefit 
The package is good "
17,15315,2023-09-13,always relaxing,"I've used this Herb Pharm relaxing sleep formula for quite some time and have recommended it to family ad friends. It's gently potent, allowing one to ease into sleep if needed and rise without any left over heaviness of sleep. It's also a great nervine if stressed, that restores balance and restfulness."
18,15315,2023-07-20,Best sleep remedy I've found!,"I've tried a lot of sleep remedies, and this is by far the one for me. It's gentle, and I don't wake up groggy at all. I like that is does not contain melatonin, since there are issues with taking that long term. The hops is also good for menopausal women's sleep issues."
19,15315,2023-03-18,,"I purchased this supplement product to promote sleep and relaxation and am satisfied. It contains several quality ingredients. I dilute it in a glass of water. There is a mild bitter taste, but that’s totally fine for me. I also like that the product was packaged well and didn’t leak during shipment."
20,15315,2022-12-01,This stuff works.,"I use this tincture when I really need a night of quality, uninterrupted sleep. It sometimes makes me feel sleepy, so I take it with a little water about an hour before I'd like to go to sleep. Taste isn't the best. Great for folks who can't take supplements in pill form. Simple ingredients and effective."
21,15315,2024-09-26,,Great product and highly effective. This was a repurchase and highly recommend. 
22,15315,2024-06-30,Amazing ,Great quality ingredients and taste for sleep and relax perfect size 
23,15315,2024-06-19,Herb Pharm is a quality tincture,An excellent nighttime solution for better sleep. I keep it on hand. Herb Pharm tinctures are easy to the taste.
24,15315,2024-04-11,YUCK!,"The taste is bitter and repulsive.  I can usually stomach stuff like this but not this one.  Also, I'm not sure if it was this product in and of itself or the combination of this taken with a sleep aid nighttime tea, but it had me up all night peeing relentlessly.  No effect on sleep whatsoever; quite the opposite for me.  I returned the product."
25,15315,2024-03-15,Puts me to sleep,I've been using Relaxing Sleep for about four months.  It makes me drowsy and keeps me asleep all night. 
26,15315,2024-02-13,Great ,"great product, helps a lot with falling asleep and having a good night's sleep"
27,15315,2023-11-09,Great ,Helps a lil tastes and smells very alcoholic but it’s manageable 
28,15315,2023-03-10,relaxes you,"I had used this in my sleep tea before bed, fall asleep easily, relaxes you, taste is a little bad if you do it straight .Sometime I try it if I wake up in the middle of the night, Sometimes works sometimes not, doesnt make you feel out of it ,just relaxed"
29,15315,2024-10-14,Soothing and induce quietness. ,Do just what it is supposed to do. Not too fast though.  
30,15315,2024-04-15,Seems to be working so far,Taste is average but does seem to be working to help fall asleep 
31,15315,2023-09-08,"takes a little while, but works! ","I use this when I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. It’s been working, so far so good. But I am a little sleepy the next day. "
32,15315,2023-01-08,,Maybe it’s a placebo effect but I feel like I sleep really really well when I take this.  The flavor is pretty bad but totally worth it for how effective this is.  
33,15315,2023-11-03,"Doesn't work on me at all, formula not strong enough","Doesn't work on me at all unfortunately, I bought 3 bottles and tried, the formula is very diluted I think.
I don't recommend it, there are other companies with single plants that worked really hard for me. I will buy them now."
34,15315,2023-05-08,,"not too sure about this one, maybe I am more sensitive so even just a little bit of this was too much. Though I do like this brand and their quality ingredients so I do still support people taking this if they have trouble sleeping as they make be less sensitive than me. The taste is quite strong though as the composition has a few things in its blend. Hopefully when my body is less sensitive it will be able to absorb and tolerate this better."
35,15315,2022-02-12,,"As an herbalist who makes my own tinctures about half the time, I rely on Herb Pharm for purchased tinctures. This blend of relaxing herbs is one I can tolerate and which works for me. I am sensitive to plants in the asteraceae family (chamomile featured in this extract), but I tolerate this product well. I alternate taking a tincture like this or even the California Poppy by Herb Pharm with melatonin, so I take one or the other at night to help me ease into a good sleep."
36,15315,2024-07-01,"Strong taste, okay effect",Didn’t help me fall asleep consistently but it did help sometimes 
37,15315,2022-04-22,,"Good product. 30 ml is too little... They could do a bottle double package because it doesn't lasts the whole month. I take it with adrenal support of the same brand, it helps me to sleep and calm me down. Gave me benefits , the composition is not the best, I don't like the taste and the alcohol but it really improved my sleep! "
38,15315,2022-02-22,"Tastes bad, works great","I find this extremely bitter, though I had someone else try it, and they actually liked it, so I guess it's very subjective. However, I first tried this on a day when I was under a lot of stress, and it really helped me to feel less stressed, and to accomplish the things which I needed to accomplish. I highly recommend this tincture blend. "
39,15315,2022-07-04,,"I started taking this instead of melatonin, from which I was getting terrible side effects. This relaxes me at times when I can't sleep and includes several herbs recommended to me by an herbalist. She also totally recommends the whole Herb Pharm range!"
40,15315,2021-11-18,Actually Works!,"I have used many different sleep products over the years and this one actually works! I can feel myself calming and slowing down about 30 mins after i take it. No foggy after effect the next day like prescription sleep stuff, yet way more potent than melatonin "
41,15315,2023-06-07,Time will tell...,"Not convinced that this product works. I wanted to try a sleep supplement in tincture form, as I take so many pills/ supplements already. However, I haven't noticed an difference yet and I've been taking it for 3 weeks. Maybe it needs more time, or maybe I need something stronger than a tincture.."
42,15315,2023-06-01,,"Good ingredients,packaging .Slept easy and fast .Taste is reasonable "
43,15315,2023-05-09,,amazing sleep after taking it for the first time. will definitely keep taking. 
44,15315,2023-05-07,很好！,Good for sleep as well as very natural for human users 
45,15315,2023-02-18,,good ingredients and excellent price. Great anti age suppliment and great quality. Will buy again.
46,15315,2023-01-15,,I’ve been using this for awhile. I have restless leg syndrome and insomnia. This really helps me to relax and fall asleep.
47,15315,2023-01-02,,I fall asleep fast and wake up refreshed. I will buy this product again.
48,15315,2022-10-30,Helpful for falling asleep,This is helpful for falling asleep if I am having trouble winding down. I would recommend. 
49,15315,2024-09-13,Didn’t affect my sleep ,Did not improve my insomnia. I drink cherry juice instead
50,15315,2024-05-27,Do your research ,"If you're a migraine sufferer this very much triggers them, im sure it'll work for anyone else just not me "
51,15315,2022-10-11,,"This really helps with bedtime , my teen has a very hard time going to bed and taking this an hour before has made a huge difference!"
52,15315,2022-06-05,מצוין!,"I love this product, and using it for a long time. Whenever I feel stressed I take it and sleep great all through the night."
53,15315,2022-02-11,A Knock Out!,Knock-out drops when added to SleepyTime Tea for insomnia. I add a few drops to enhance any kind of bedtime tea for a better and quicker night's sleep.
54,15315,2023-08-16,,Taste good and soothing to the throat. Really nice. Thank you.
55,15315,2022-12-27,,"Good, but not my favourite. Anxiety Soother works much better for me and relaxes faster"
56,15315,2022-03-12,Unfortunate mixup,"The bottles artived perfectly oackaged but unfortunately were a substitute the web site offered in exchange for out of stock liquid valerian drops. The return process was fast & easy. I reordered to desired pure valerian made by a different manufacturer & it arrived quickly & in perfect condition.

2 drops per day keeps my epileptic dog from having fits. So I  must be careful about the ingredients."
57,15315,2009-10-07,Love this stuff!,"I always keep a bottle of this at my bed side. Have been using it for years. Really helps with sleep. Usually take it with Moon Drops (homeopathic lozenges) you can't get at iherb, but can get at most health food stores. The combination seems to really work and doesn't make you groggy the next day."
58,15315,2009-08-16,Does the trick,"I have been using Herb Pharm's sleep tonic for about a year now. I find it strong so I cut the dose to only 10-15 drops in a small amount of water. I can depend on it to make me feel sleepy even when I don't feel tired. My only complaint is that I have come accross the odd ""bad batch"" which doesn't do much. This has never happened with iherb but rather when I've purchased the bottle in a store. I think it may be old, since it will taste weak and the bottle has no expiration that I can see. That's why I shop iherb."
59,15315,2024-07-11,好的,睡前飲一些，感覺幾好瞓。
60,15315,2022-03-09,,I was thinking before sleep for 5 days. I like how it works on me.
61,15315,2023-10-04,Doesn’t work,"I tried it a few times and doesn’t seem to work for me. Also, the taste is horrible, not for the valerian, but for the amount of alcohol that’s in it. Would not buy again or recommend "
62,15315,2022-10-03,Doesn’t work for me ,"The tincture does make me a little drowsy soon after taking it, but it does nothing for me in terms of falling asleep sooner or staying asleep. Which is what I’m ultimately after. Maybe it will work for others, but not for me "
63,15315,2018-02-01,Insomniac,"Very few things work for me and this is one. Unfortunately, it tastes horrendous. Ive tried it in everything from plain water to soda and in my opinion it tastes the least in Sunny-D. It usually take about 10-20 minutes depending on how buzzed my brain is but at the very least it has a relaxing effect."
64,15315,2023-02-10,,"Its okay, not for me though. I dont like the taste and aftertaste of it. The quality matches the quantity though. "
65,15315,2022-07-06,,"Helps feel relax and sleep better. I usually add it to water 1 hour before sleep, taste is fine"
66,15315,2022-05-31,For sleep hygiene ,Tried everything from the market. This one still works for me
67,15315,2021-01-27,,"It is helpful to get me a deep sleep. I didn't take it every night. Only when I felt restless, then I took a few drops to relax myself before bed time. I felt the effetcs with half am hour."
68,15315,2009-02-20,The best yet!~,"This has an amazing combo of herbs to relax the body.  If I am having a rought time sleeping, I take one full dropper and one Serenity and sleep like a baby! Best thing I have found yet."
69,15315,2022-02-28,Great Sleep aid,I love using this herbal combination when I have trouble sleeping; it does the job with no after effects like grogginess the next morning.
70,15315,2014-02-04,Works pretty well,This is my favorite sleep aid.  It works way better than just melatonin.  I don't feel groggy the next day.  It doesn't have the effect if making it harder to sleep the next night.
71,15315,2021-07-15,Excellent herbal sleep tonic!,"This organic herbal sleep tonic from Herb Pharm has become a staple in my sleep routine. It contains organic versions of sleep promoting herbs and flowers (valerian root, passion flower, hops, chamomile, and catnip flower herb). I put 3/4 to 1 pipette full of the tincture into an herbal tea (such as tulsi tea) and drink it 1 or 2 hours before going to sleep. In addition to this tincture, I also take melatonin capsules and diffuse lavender essential oil - which is also sleep promoting."
72,15315,2021-08-25,Beautiful Supplement,"... but not my preferred. I think it's the taste & I get a bit of a hit in the chest after I take it. I prefer the Lemon Balm option, now having tried both. Either way, I think it does it's job - Relaxing Sleep!"
73,15315,2015-11-19,Good sleep promoter,"The best OTC sleep promoter I've found.  It creates a relaxed, bemused state.  And it's cheaper than many other tinctures purporting to aid sleep.  "
74,15315,2011-03-01,Not Sure,I've gone thru two bottles as directed but not sleeping as well as expected.  Going off Caffeine has helped my sleep more than anything in a bottle.
75,15315,2021-06-26,,I bought this for when I have occasional sleepless nights. Puts me straight to sleep when I'm having trouble falling asleep! 
76,15315,2021-02-28,,Definitely noticed a difference in how fast I am able to relax and fall asleep
77,15315,2019-11-29,"Good product, effcient for a teenager","Very efficient for my daughter (she is 14), who always has difficulties to fall asleep."
78,15315,2018-02-24,works like  a charm.,"It really helped me to relax before bed time. I'll use it now and then. 
"
79,15315,2021-08-21,,"This works really well for me if I need a nap, but have trouble falling asleep or relaxing enough to feel rested."
80,15315,2021-03-12,,Works great to take the edge off the day and fall asleep faster! Use  three droppers every night in a little water
81,15315,2018-02-18,Very effective,"Though the taste is strong, it definitely does the job and is safe, not addictive."
82,15315,2022-08-15,,Really good. I like littlebit more without alcohol.
83,15315,2018-07-07,Doesn't suit me," after taking it, i felt the brain is blank... but couldn't sleep!  it's worse than before I take it.  Taste terrible too.  I checked the comments before buying it, but I didn't believe when ppl say it tastes terrible.  Now I can confirm!"
84,15315,2016-10-24,Sleep aid,"I really can't say if this has helped me sleep, as I haven't noticed a difference yet. I don't like to write bad reviews but the taste is pretty awful even with water."
85,15315,2022-03-07,,Excellent 
86,15315,2022-01-17,Прекрасно!,Super
87,15315,2021-11-21,,The taste is disgusting. Horrible! I will never buy again. 
88,15315,2010-03-12,sleep,helps with sleep but the taste is horrid i get past it
89,15315,2020-12-12,Didn’t work for me,"I’m sure it’s personal preference but this didn’t work for me. Strong flavour but easy to administer, but no results for me. I had better luck with higher dose plain valerian. "
90,15315,2021-06-13,,It puts me back to sleep
91,15315,2021-02-16,,Helpful nighttime tincture. I would buy again.
92,15315,2014-09-28,Nothing!,Tried it a few times when agitated and could not calm me down enuff to sleep much.
93,15315,2021-08-08,,one of my favourites 
94,15315,2021-05-15,,Very goo for sleeping
95,15315,2021-01-09,,works well
96,15315,2020-12-20,,Highly recommend

101,15315,2021-06-05,,Not much of help
102,15315,2020-12-09,,Helps me to sleep
103,15315,2024-01-30,A wonderful relaxant,"I have very big problems with sleep, this product works great, I ordered two bottles at once because the volume is small and this is a minus, but with relaxation it works very well, it became much easier to fall asleep. I recommend two pipettes at once before going to bed and you will notice the result in a week."
104,15315,2023-11-12,Drops for sound sleep,"Very good quality of these drops for relaxing and sound sleep, they are made from natural ingredients. Jar together with a dropper, it is very convenient to take drops. Took to improve sleep, for stress. The effect was excellent, the sleep was sound without night awakenings. Along with the drops, she also took magnesium. I recommend"
105,15315,2024-08-30,A wonderful drug ,"It relaxes very well, it tastes a bit bitter, but the main thing is that it is effective, I have been taking it for a year now and not a single parcel is complete without this drug))"
106,15315,2024-06-30,Quality and benefit.,Herbal tincture with ethyl alcohol. Strong enough. Needs to be diluted with water. It is better to hold it in your mouth for faster action. Helps you fall asleep if you drink it half an hour before bedtime.
107,15315,2024-03-09,,"Stress at work unfortunately led to insomnia; in an attempt to find a solution, I purchased this supplement. I like that it comes in drops and is easy to dose. There is definitely an effect."
108,15315,2024-10-10,,"The quality is normal, the ingredients as well, but I did not notice the wow effect. the taste is neutral, it seemed to me that I would sleep better with it, but this did not happen "
109,15315,2023-08-04,,"I have problems with sleep, namely for a long time I can’t fall asleep half the night I turn around. In the morning, sleepy and sleepy, then I go and tired, I decided to try these drops. Really soothe chtol easily fall asleep with them and finally slept in the morning."

Normalizes the psycho-emotional state, promotes the production of serotonin, calms, improves mood. I used one or two pipettes in the afternoon. The taste is not the best. Nice packaging, glass jar, easy to use."
