0,117952,2024-02-18,Energy and reduced estrogen level,"My naturopath recommended to take chrysin for elevated estrogen level. I am taking one capsule in the morning after breakfast. It is going on only for 2 weeks now, so cannot tell you if it is effective or not. No side effects either so far. I will get a hormone test at the end of the month to check the impact of chrysin."
1,117952,2023-12-30,Helps me sleep!,"This is my first time using this supplement.  I was looking for a substitute for the one I used to buy in the previous country I lived.  The main ingredient was passionflower.  When I wake in the night and can't get back to sleep, I take a capsule and, after a while, I'm able to get back to sleep.  It's better than using prescription sleeping pills, I think, because it's non-addictive and the effect doesn't diminish over time.  "
2,117952,2024-06-03,So far so good,"I've recently started using Chrysin from Swanson, and my experience has been very good so far.

Firstly, the quality of this supplement is impressive. The capsules are easy to take, and I haven't experienced any unpleasant aftertaste or side effects, which is always a plus. It's evident that Swanson prioritizes high standards in their product formulation.
The product seems to be effective in supporting my hormonal health, which was my primary reason for choosing Chrysin.

Additionally, the packaging is convenient and the instructions are clear, making it easy to follow the recommended dosage. I also appreciate the reasonable price point, which offers great value for a high-quality supplement.

While it's still early days, my experience with Swanson Chrysin has been very positive. If you’re looking for a reliable and effective Chrysin supplement, I highly recommend giving Swanson a try. I’m looking forward to seeing the long-term benefits as I continue to use it."
3,117952,2023-10-26,,"I just found this supplement being part of a great rated immune boosting, but can't be delivered where I live, so I just looked up at the ingredients and I am trying to created myself.  I am so happy because I could find everything that I needed on here."
4,117952,2024-09-01,Pretty good, I read that it is good for metabolism and energy production. I had no problems taking it and feel it helped me in some ways so it probably had good quality. I will buy some some more.
5,117952,2024-08-04,great,Taking chrysin from passionflower has been a game-changer for me. It’s enhanced my sleep quality and seems to have a soothing effect on my nerves. Definitely worth trying for those seeking natural calmness.

9,117952,2024-01-29,Good product ,I liked the product and the delivery was quick. I liked the packaging. I liked the smell of the product because I had already bought it once from another brand where the smell of the capsules was very bad.
10,117952,2023-09-01,Interesting,"I love passionflower, and to know this is derived from it makes instant sense! I think I will need to give it a longer try, but overall I have felt an improvement in my energy levels, mentally and physically. I think this is best taken with some bit of food, perhaps an hour or two after could work best, seems to have a pressure lowering effect for me. Will keep experimenting and update this by the end of the bottle."
11,117952,2023-06-01,Großartig!,"Great for increasing free testosteron in a natural way, which gives me an extra boost in the gym also. -Take only one in the morning/s (for two weeks) and lets me experience the horniest morning woods, sometimes lasting really looong ;-)... going to order it again, for sure. After two weeks I switch to TribX 90 for another two weeks (weekends off), also taking it in the mornings, just to let my body not get used to it too fast.  "

34,117952,2023-09-08,,Didn’t find this to be particularly helpful for my MCAS. I take a lot of different supps and it can be hard to tell. I don’t think I will repurchase but Swanson is a decent brand and it’s worth giving a shot depending on what you are taking it for.
