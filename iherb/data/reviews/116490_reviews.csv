0,116490,2024-04-02,Helps,"The variety of ingredients seem to be of good quality. Once you get past the smell which is sort of like rotting fish, these large pills take anywhere from 30 min. to 1 hr. to gently induce a mild sleepiness. 1 pill will keep me under for about 4 hrs. then I have to take another one and I was hoping for a somewhat greater effectiveness to really make me drowsy, so for me they're just average. Have to say that I don't wake up feeling groggy, so they're good also in that respect. Will continue to use them as perhaps it takes my body time to adjust after using sublingual melatonin by itself for many years but will keep the sublingual melatonin on the back burner.
UPDATE--My body has adjusted to ""Luna"". Taken about 1/2 hr. prior to hopeful sleep, fall into a good sound sleep until the bladder says 'wake up'! Luna does help and will reorder. Should mention that I do follow up the 1 Luna softgel with a 1 mg. sublingual melatonin, all of which has been providing some much-needed restful sleep."
