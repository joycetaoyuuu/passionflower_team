0,121212,2024-06-11,Special Scent,"The best scent in my opinion for this brand. Texture is pretty thick yet easy to absorb. Not greasy even in summer, from the northern hemisphere so it tends to be pretty dry. Scent is rather uplifting rather than calming. I would say moisturizing power is so and so. Won't be enough for cold North winters and it suits the spring summer season. tube is kind of big to carry around so I keep it at home.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.188, 'compound': 0.9451}",0.9451,pos
1,121212,2024-03-10,I LOVE my ZUM!,"Zum lotions are great. I use the Sea Salt when I'm looking for less of a scent all over my body. When it's the hands or feet, I use the Lavender one which is amazing as well. They are very moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. The natural essential oils in them have a huge benefit and I feel really good using them. The lotion is thicker and applies well. I definitely always have a Zum lotion on me at all times.

8,121212,2023-10-08,Great lotion,"This  lotion is light and hydrating. I don't know why the other reviewer said it smells weird and stays strong smelling. It doesn't. If you are used to ""perfumey"" lotions that have have fake scents then you might not go for this. All the scents are from the essential oils and they are really nice.  It's a little earthy (like a slight sandalwood) so if you like flowery sweet smells it might not be your thing. Again, it's very faint after  a while. I love Zum. It's hard to find this price point with quality ingredients. They also use meadowfoam which another expensive brand has with fake perfume stink so I'm grateful this one is natural! :)","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.9374}",0.9374,pos
