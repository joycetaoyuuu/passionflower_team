62,56089,2021-05-30,Excellent! Though the taste takes a little getting used to.,"I bought this because of the mix of lavender oil and kava kava. I tried it this afternoon after a hard morning that resulted in a stress headache. I took care of the headache at lunch and at about 2, still feeling a little anxious from the stress of the morning, I decided to give this a try. One squeezer full into 2 oz of water is recommended. If you like the smell of lavender oil you may like this. The smell is of full on distilled lavender oil. The smell in water is beautiful (to me), and breathing that alone may help some people in the way aromatherapy can. Seriously, the smell is strong and it looks a little funny in water, and before drinking it you will come read reviews again on iHerb before you decide that yes, you really are supposed to drink this. That's what I did. Best drunk quickly. I did and here's what I noticed. I've been a kava drinker for more than twenty years. About 10 minutes after drinking this product, I noticed the familiar slight numbing on the roof of my mouth that is characteristic of kava kava. That's a good sign for me, as kava has always been my go to anxiety reducer. After about 45 minutes, I was feeling mildly relaxed and things that were bothering me earlier suddenly weren't. So, do I think it works? Yes, for me, it does. It's not the full on effect of drinking bowls of kava five minutes apart (if you are ever invited in the Polynesian triangle), but it's a good effect nonetheless. Probably good before bed or long meditation. And while it is hard to drink, I do love the smell, and drinking it will get better over time. I will be buying Herb Pharm Anxiety Soother again.
