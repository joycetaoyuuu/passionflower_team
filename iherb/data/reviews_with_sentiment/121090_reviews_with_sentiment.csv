0,121090,2024-07-23,Anxiety and Stress relief for dogs,"Our 2 year old American Staffy is very anxious when we leave the house, this product gives him a sense of calmness if we are going to be gone for a longer period of time. We have recently had quite a few storms and this product has been great and he has slept through majority of the noise, normally he would have run around the house. He thinks they are treats so they must taste ok, haven't tried myself :)","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.6158}",0.6158,pos
1,121090,2024-09-17,It does the job.,"My dog does not like, so I have to crumble it into his food and once it kicks in he seems to be a bit calmer.  Unfortunately, I will have to search for one that he likes and will take willingly while traveling.  Other than my baby not liking these chews, it works.","{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': -0.12}",-0.12,neg
2,121090,2023-12-16,Dog dependant ,"Update! These work amazing well on my younger chihuahua (1kg). Even 1/4 of a tablet brings her into a nice neutral mood. From my review below, I had to use a  different natural product (one for cushings,)which saw a vast improvement in my older dogs anxiety and her behaviour around visitors.
Quality packaging and a good list of ingredients, I haven‚Äôt really seen the benefits in my dogs behaviour yet, but maybe it will be a build up effect. As she‚Äôs gotten older my Chihuahua doesn‚Äôt deal with visitors as well as she used to, and I was hoping these would give her a bit of calm.

16,121090,2024-08-07,Unbelievable,"This supplement for dogs with thiamine and L-tryptophan is a real lifesaver for us in stressful situations! Our dog has always been nervous during travel, thunderstorms and fireworks, but with these chewable tablets he has become much calmer. What I particularly like is the quality of the ingredients. Ginger helps support a sensitive stomach, which is especially important when traveling. And melatonin helps our four-legged friend relax and rest. We noticed that he really felt better within 30 minutes of taking it. It is very convenient that the dose is easily adjusted depending on the dog's weight, and the tablets themselves have a pleasant taste for him. The application instructions are clear and we follow them without any problems. The quality of the product is excellent and its performance exceeded our expectations. We recommend it to all dog owners who are looking for a reliable means to reduce stress and anxiety in their pets.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.292, 'compound': 0.9942}",0.9942,pos
