1,121207,2024-06-02,The Almond Scent is Perfection!,"This hand cream is giving me everything I am looking for: a mild scent, nice rich texture, quick dry time and a great price! I'm not usually into scented lotions, but I made an exception for this almond scent and am so happy I did- I really like the scent- it makes me feel fancy.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.665, 'pos': 0.335, 'compound': 0.9645}",0.9645,pos
2,121207,2024-03-02,Very gentle effective moisturizer,"Recently I have become very sensitive to moisturizing lotions, but have excessively dry skin especially on my legs.  Very  hard to find one that doesn't cause a bad reaction.  This one is so gentle and nice, very moisturizing, not sticky, makes my legs feel smooth and silky and hydrates very well.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.708, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.9435}",0.9435,pos
3,121207,2024-08-24,Smells yummy,"I have pretty dry skin and have been using this cream mainly for hands and feet. It smells yummy when applied and grandually mellows out, so isn't overwhelming. It is nice and creamy, feels good going on, and absorbs fairly quickly, but doesn't really seem to have lasting benefits. I would say it's better than some.

4,121207,2024-05-13,,"It is a nice light lotion. It's not thick so, it's easy to spread. The scent is a bit strong at first but fades decently fast. 
My only problem was that my skin is very sensitive and my hands didn't agree with this lotion. My skin got very itchy and I had to stop using it as a hand cream - which was my initial intention. 
Otherwise, hydrating deeply with no heaviness to it.
The tube is pretty big too.
A good quality product for bitter almond lovers.","{'neg': 0.171, 'neu': 0.62, 'pos': 0.209, 'compound': 0.633}",0.633,pos

8,121207,2023-11-26,Love it,I tried the lavender scent which I loved and thought I would try this. The scent is a bit strong as stated in other reviews but does disapate.

9,121207,2024-03-11,Smells Great,"This is a nice quality lotion that smells great. However the fragrance does not last as much as I would like. I use it as a hand lotion before I go to bed and it works really well. I don't use it as often as a daytime lotion, because it leaves my hands feeling a bit sticky.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.277, 'compound': 0.9381}",0.9381,pos

15,121207,2024-06-06,Worthless,"This is the only 1 star I have ever left on Iherb out of hundreds of reviews. First of all the consistency is runny. Then the overwhelming smell of imitation almond scent hits you (a cheap overly sweet cherry scent). Next is the sticky, tacky film it leaves on your hands especially between your fingers, love that. And just when you think this product was just bad - there's not a hint of moisture to be had.  Sorry for the bad review, but I look forward to honesty when I'm reading them and looking for some guidance before a blind purchase. Hope this helps üôè","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.8608}",0.8608,pos

23,121207,2023-11-29,good,I already had this product from this very good brand in another perfume (myrrh) and I wanted to test another perfume from this very good brand which makes body care products with a remarkable composition. I find that the almond scent is very strong upon application but then it fades.

24,121207,2023-11-20,Almond scent,"Speaking of the ZUM series, it's all about fragrance. This is an almond scent that smells a little alcoholic, but the almond scent isn't too sweet. It tastes like almond tofu. It's a body cream that feels a little thicker than creamy, and although it has a similar scent, I think it's suitable for winter.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.0077}",0.0077,neu
25,121207,2024-09-06,This is a Japanese review,"When I opened the lid and smelled it, it had a sweet almond scent. I thought it would be good for winter, so I tried putting a small amount on my arm, and it had a strong alcohol-like pungent scent. Where was the almond scent from before?! I was surprised. It was more like paint thinner than alcohol. I wondered if I was the only one who got something strange, so I went to look at the reviews and found that there were other people who also wrote that it smelled like alcohol, so I thought maybe I didn't get a bad one. What kind of scent is this? I couldn't figure it out even after looking at the ingredients. I was worried, is it okay to wear it? The texture is loose and easy to apply, but it leaves a lot of oil on the skin and makes it sticky. I think it's good for winter.","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9287}",0.9287,pos
26,121207,2024-09-09,Light cream,"I bought this as a replacement for hand cream. It's a large size and good value for money. It's a light flavor, so it might not be suitable for those who like rich flavors.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.369, 'compound': 0.9274}",0.9274,pos
