0,66284,2024-05-22,Wow. Major calmer for stressful events,When we gave this to our dogs—two salukis with strong anxiety—they pretty much fell asleep immediately. This is the kind of stuff you want for when they are going to do something stressful - like go to the vet or go in a car.  They were back up to being hyper and agitated as usual later in the day so I do not know that this works well as a long-term medicine but it works well for event-related stress. They happily ate the tablet with no fuss. ,"{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.5574}",0.5574,pos

You need to allow couple of days for the effect to slightly build up so I'd say this is not a product for instant calming result - I hope that serves to those who are about to travel etc to start giving the pills couple of days before.

Also, do not expect any sedation signs - this is a natural remedy not chemical sedative so it takes away the anxiety but cannot calm down your pet if the stressy situation is average and high.

Just to prevent him from scratching himself. My cat has obsessive-compulsive disorder. I hope the manufacturer can make it taste good for cats. This money is wasted. Please see the photo, I crushed the tablets and mixed them into the cat's favorite cat strips, but my cat wouldn't eat them. The first two days, my cat wouldn't eat them, I was at a loss, then I broke the tablets into very small pieces and sandwiched them in freeze-dried food, and my baby happily ate them. Today is the second day, and she seems to be really quiet. If the effect continues. I will give 5 stars. My baby scratches herself like this, my heart is broken. Today is October 19, 2024. My cat kicked off the Elizabethan collar on the 15th and I never wore it again. He also did not over-interpret the compulsive behavior of hair. Share the method of taking this medicine: you can break this medicine into very small pieces, put each piece into a square freeze-dried, or put it in a sticky cat strip (there are skills when using this method. Don't put them all in the cat strip at once. First, put two small pieces into the cat strip, push the cat strip up from the bottom so that the cat strip can wrap the medicine, and then feed it to the cat. As long as he opens his mouth, keep pushing the cat strip into his mouth, so as to prevent him from spitting out the medicine). After taking this medicine, the cat feels quieter.
