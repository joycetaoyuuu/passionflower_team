0,68757,2024-09-09,A good PTS without melatonin ,"I got this power to sleep because it does not contain melatonin which can give you nightmares if you take too much. I‚Äôll mix it with the other PTS to reduce the melatonin. This one contains California poppy that helps you sleep for an alternative to the melatonin. It seems like a quality brand that provides liquid capsules instead of dry. I feel liquid is fresher and contains a more efficacious delivery of the constituents-vitamins/supplements ingredients. The size is not huge-50 pills which they want you to take 3. I‚Äôll take 2, and one of the other ‚Äòpower to sleep‚Äô (with melatonin) capsules to round it out. I got it on sale 28% off so bought 3! I should have enough to last for a while till the next sale.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.947, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.69}",0.69,pos
1,68757,2024-05-22,Nice relaxing sleep facilitator ,I like this ‚Äúpower to sleep‚Äù by Irwin Naturals because it contains California poppy which is a gentle relaxer. I believe it also is a mild pain reliever because it‚Äôs related to poppies. I will usually take one of these with the other Irwin power to sleep that has melatonin included in it. I mix the two because I don‚Äôt like nightmares from too much melatonin. The size is a little smaller than the other style but I like the poppy ingredient so I ordered 2 bottles to balance the other P.T.S. They are also soft gels so works faster than tablets. Irwin I believe is a good quality supplement so I order several different kinds. ,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.899}",0.899,pos

4,68757,2023-08-24,wonderful product,"I have used Irwin Naturals Power to sleep pm before; I was thrilled when I realized it comes in a melatonin free formula. I have a provider who doesn't want me to take too much melatonin in my sleep products because it's actually a hormone. I believe Irwins' are high quality products, I like what all of these specific ingredients do and there's no taste issues in a gel cap. The benefit overall is a product that works.","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.8511}",0.8511,pos
5,68757,2024-04-27,Melatonin free,"I guess I relied on sleeping pills prescribed by my doctor for a very long time that I thought why not try homeopathy.

For whatever reason it did not work well for me at all.  I suggest taking this well in advance of when you need to be asleep.  I was taking it approximately 30 minutes before and it didn't seem to kick in at all till a couple of hours later, plus I still woke up after a few hours sleep.","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.044, 'compound': 0.0279}",0.0279,neu
