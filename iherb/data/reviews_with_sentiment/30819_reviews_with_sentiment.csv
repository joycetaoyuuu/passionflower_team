We use passionflower as part of evening tea gatherings (we do it ourselves). This herb calms, relaxes, relieves stress, and promotes good sleep. I would not advise drinking it in the daytime, when increased concentration is required. In addition to teas, you can make infusions and infusions with passionflower. It is not advised to use passionflower for atherosclerosis of the vessels of the heart muscle and brain, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris.
