2,142876,2024-09-14,Fantastic bedtime help,"The Mantra Rest is an absolutely fantastic product I added to my nighttime routine when I feel my brain isn't calmed down enough to fall asleep for the night.

The Mantra Rest dissolves well and doesn't add any texture to the drink. Wonderful quality product that does its job! 
As a side note, don't take it if you're not ready to go to bed - there were two separate times when unexpectedly I had to do other things before going to sleep, and I got a horrible headache each time. Just be ready for sleep before taking this and you'll absolutely love this product, too!","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.9211}",0.9211,pos
