0,113252,2024-07-12,CanineCalming chews,Our Boykin spaniel gets these before a bath or toenail clipping. This year we used them over the 4th when so many fireworks were going off. She considers them a top treat and they do seem to relax her without causing drowsiness. We will always keep them in stock.

2,113252,2024-02-29,–ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ!,"Thank you very much for this product, it suited me, I like the packaging, comfortable and stylish, I will order more of these products, and recommend them to all my friends and relatives! good!!
"
3,113252,2023-10-22,,"I think they are very good. I believe I that I saw the effects after constant using it, not immediately. The smell is nice my dogs loves it as a treat "
4,113252,2023-01-29,üëçüèΩ nice,these are good for my puppy. he gets fussy when we are at work and this helps him calm down. I also gave him a piece before going to the vet for the very first time. he loves them!
5,113252,2024-05-12,Didn‚Äôt notice any calming,"The benefit of these chews were that they taste good enough that my dogs ate them without making a fuss, that‚Äôs the only reason they get 2 stars. No calmness to be had."
6,113252,2022-09-24,,"My dog has developed pretty serious anxiety in his older years and actually has a prescription. I like to use chews on days when I know there might be issues and save the pills for serious attacks. These work very well to keep him clam during every day stressors. He still needs the prescription for things like bad storms, but these definitely help. "
7,113252,2022-06-12,,"We have three dogs - (1, 3 and 7). They‚Äôre each about 50-60 pounds - these chews recommend two for their size (other brands say three). They chews are much smaller than other brands and smell like very potent beef jerky. Package came with no issues - quality of the product is hands down the best we have come across in over eight years. Our pups love them and it really helps them with their anxiety! We will definitely continue using this and we would strongly recommend it to anyone!"
8,113252,2023-05-31,,Can't say it works better than other products but it is working. My dog doesn't like the taste much. it doesn't smell like bacon but smells like herbs.
9,113252,2023-03-30,,"excellent product,good and strong packaging , the quality matches the description, I will still recommend ordering to everyone!!! okay

10,113252,2022-08-16,,"These calming chews work AWESOME for my nephew's dogs, however the melatonin made my little 7lb Terrier kinda whiny. So,I gave the treats to them."
11,113252,2022-05-06,,My doggie loves the taste. Just not sure if it's working the way it should then we just started taking it.  Also think it would be better if it has only peanut butter taste. 
12,113252,2023-06-29,,"My dog don't like the taste, he don't want to eat it"
13,113252,2024-08-18,Great vitamins,"Very high-quality useful vitamins for my dog, after two weeks of taking it, he began to react less to loud sounds. The size of the vitamins is large, but they are soft and I break them up and add them to the feed. Everything is great because I can see the result"
14,113252,2024-04-23,,"I liked everything, the quality, the taste, the method of use, everything seems to be taken into account here. The pet appreciated, this product helps to solve the problem with the behavior and well-being of the dog, I can already see the benefits and clear improvements"
15,113252,2024-03-12,Excellent!,"My dog really liked the taste; as a stand-alone sedative, the drug is rather weak in combination; it works well. On an ongoing basis, it works well as a support, and normalizes sleep. "
16,113252,2024-09-24,Very good,"It works gently, it calms down well. The dog eats with pleasure. There is no need to deceive."
17,113252,2024-07-04,,"Liked The dog eats with pleasure! Even I smell nice. thank you 
"

19,113252,2024-03-07,Not effective ,"My dog didn't care about them, she ate them like treats, she didn't notice the effect "
20,113252,2022-12-03,Excellent!,Cool product. My Khas feels like a Dalai Lama. Helps to cope with the fear of thunder.
