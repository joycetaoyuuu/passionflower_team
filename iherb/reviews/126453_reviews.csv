0,126453,2024-07-13,Sweet dreams!,Oregon's Wild Harvest has helped me overcome my insomnia. I love this mixture and I don't take anywhere near the suggested amount.  I take about 5-7 drops half an  hour before bed.  I go right to sleep and go back to sleep easily if I have to get up and visit the bathroom.  No hangover in the morning.  I don't even have to take it every night any more.  Just when I feel wound up.  I trust this company and recommend this supplement.
