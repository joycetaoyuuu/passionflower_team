1,107931,2023-11-02,,I have a very anxious and loyal blue heeler with tons of separation anxiety. This product keeps him from tearing apart his beds in the kennel while I am away from him without leaving him drowsy.
2,107931,2024-01-19,Not sure if it helped,"My dog has severe separation anxiety and I have been taking this but it did not change much, I will keep feeding to see if there is an change"
3,107931,2024-08-21,,"It´s a good product but it doesn´t work right away. Changes in my dog were not seen inmediatly, but mainly is becuase my dog is very anxitious. 
"
4,107931,2024-07-26,great,It took me a while to see the effects of this medicine but now I can see that my dog is less agitated throughout the day. 
5,107931,2024-04-18,Not sure on the effectiveness,I have tried various dosages ranging from 2-4 a day. I do not notice any significant changes in my dog’s behaviour after taking this. Not sure if I need to feed her very regularly for this to have the intended effect.
6,107931,2024-02-21,Calming effect,"Seems to work on my dog although I cannot  say that my dog's calming behaviour is 100% attributed to the product. He loves it and I do see that his anxiety is the same as the past
"
7,107931,2023-09-25,It really helps ,"I was skeptical before getting this product but i was desperate to try since my dog wouldn’t stop barking for hours in his crate every morning. Nothing wrong with him he just has separation anxiety after he was in boarding for 5 days. I give him 2 chews every morning, i have been using it for 2 weeks now and there has been a massive improvement he has been so calm. Great quality and packaging."

13,107931,2024-06-17,taste ok,my dog seems to enjoying it as a treat but unsure of it really helps to calm her down 
14,107931,2024-01-19,My dog barks more when he takes it,"I dont know why, but I've tried to start the therapy with my dog 3 times, but every time he gets a half (cause he's small) of the tablet, he starts berking even more. I guess this formula is not working on him. Was bought for separation anxiety, but I had to stop giving him those. "
15,107931,2023-11-27,Excelent.,"I give 5 star for this product. The item is packed and sealed. I love the product.

17,107931,2023-11-13,Nice,Good quality for my dog. They love the smell too. Easy to give to the dogs.
18,107931,2023-04-06,אישור,"The dog doesn't want to even try to chew it.  Apparently the smell of the product causes him to be rejected, unlike other products we have bought in the past for years at iherb and they are no longer in stock, so we wanted to try this product but the dog flatly refuses."
19,107931,2023-05-14,,"I would like to share my positive experience using NaturVet Emotional Support Daily Calming Aid in the form of soft chews. This product has truly helped my pet!

Firstly, I have seen noticeable improvements in my pet's emotional well-being since starting this supplement. My pet tends to experience anxiety and stress in certain situations, but with the daily use of these calming chews, I have observed a significant reduction in their anxious behavior. They seem more relaxed and at ease.

The soft chews themselves are a convenient and enjoyable way to administer the supplement. My pet eagerly takes them as if they were treats, which makes the whole process much easier. The texture and taste seem appealing to them, and I appreciate that they are made with quality ingredients.

I appreciate that NaturVet has formulated this product to provide daily support. It contains a blend of natural ingredients known for their calming properties, such as chamomile, passionflower, and ginger. I feel confident in using a product that utilizes these natural ingredients to help promote a sense of calmness and emotional balance in my pet.

The packaging of 120 soft chews is also convenient and ensures that I have an ample supply on hand. The resealable bag helps to maintain the freshness of the chews, and it's great to have a long-lasting quantity available.

Overall, I highly recommend NaturVet Emotional Support Daily Calming Aid. It has made a positive difference in my pet's emotional well-being, and the soft chews are both convenient and enjoyable for them to consume. If you have a pet that experiences anxiety or stress, this supplement may be worth considering as part of their daily routine."
20,107931,2024-08-19,,"Good for my 2 dogs, one that is highly active and another one that’s anxious"
21,107931,2022-11-11,,"Did not really have a noticable effect on my dog. She behaved almost exactly the same after as far as I could tell. Furthermore although she did nibble away at it she must not have enjoyed the taste. Had to mix it with cheese to get her to finish 1 piece. Other brands like Naturvet Quiet Moments, she gobbled down in an instant and clearly worked. Will not be repeating purchase, shame as it is value for money (120 pcs)"
22,107931,2022-11-09,,the ingredients are very effective and of good quality on my fur babies especially when i use it  during thunderstorms and occasions involving fireworks. my doggies love the taste. i will continue to use this product always!
23,107931,2023-12-14,I don't think it works,"My dog have a separation anxiety disorder, he also gets Gabapentin for his back pain and I added those .I didn't see any improvement :("

I am delighted. I have no doubt that it was a good purchase for my pet since he is a little older and very anxious. He loved the flavor and because of its size it is easy for him to take. I will definitely continue buying it."
73,107931,2024-01-10,,"We ordered it to at least slightly increase our dog’s resistance to stress. She is shy and afraid of everything. We crumble it into her food, she just doesn’t really want to eat it. The quality and composition are good, the packaging is convenient, it will last for a long time."
74,107931,2024-08-10,Great ,"This is the second version of sedatives for my dog. The previous one was from the same company, but with a slightly different composition. This version suited us better. The dog became calmer and so did I."

I have been using it with him for 2 weeks but I really have not noticed any change in his behavior. I will continue using it, perhaps with the frequency of use it will have some benefit. ."
77,107931,2024-01-27,,"One of the dogs at home is very afraid of thunder and fireworks. Giving it to him at this time will give him a calming and soothing effect! If your pet is afraid of certain situations or sounds, it is recommended to use"
78,107931,2023-07-01,,"Had a positive effect on my super anxious old dog!!! She is less frightened by sudden noises, sleeps continuously at night and looks more vital and happy😊 After a few weeks of use, the dog is calmer, and probably because of the improvement in sleep quality she is more energetic and happy during the day. Highly recommend ❤️🐶"
79,107931,2024-03-27,Perfectly,"The quality of pleasure, I give as a daily supplement for animals, large packaging,"
80,107931,2024-03-25,,The quality of the drug is at a high level. The ingredients included in the composition must be in the dog's diet. 
81,107931,2023-11-09,excellent,I bought it for my dog for the period of anxiety now during the war.. big packaging use as needed
82,107931,2023-11-01,calm and relaxed,"my dog loves the treat, it takes a moment until an effect is noticeable, very good, give daily, ideal before stressful moments (thunderstorms)"

84,107931,2022-11-30,,"The dog likes to eat it very much. After eating it for a week, the dog is less restless, but it still barks when someone walks past the door."
85,107931,2024-07-29,,I have noticed that my pets have behaved more calmly.
86,107931,2023-11-02,cute,Excellent ingredients and the size is really good but not very helpful just a bit soothing they ate it happily
87,107931,2024-05-22,My dog did not connect,Didn't even agree to taste it even when it's wrapped in sausage so I have no idea if it even works Like if it helped you :)
88,107931,2022-10-03,,"I received it a few days ago and immediately began to give it to my dog. I add it to food, so she just did not eat. After using it for a few days, my dog became much calmer. Endless licking stopped every night, barking also at night. She seems to be in a good mood. Too bad I didn't know about this before."
89,107931,2022-09-18,,"I took these ""sweets for the mood"" purely to try and was very pleasantly surprised. Sometimes ponytails also tear the roof for some unknown reason. After about a week of taking these ""cubes"" my 6 year old little one became much calmer and more balanced. I will most likely order more."
90,107931,2022-07-24,,"Since we got a very emotional dog, there is a need for sedatives. We give on an ongoing basis. We use other means in parallel, since our case is not simple. Due to problems with his paws, our dog underwent several operations, which aggravated the situation with the behavior. As a whole it works well. But, we have no experience of using it on our own yet. I think if the problem is not as big as ours, the remedy should help on its own."
91,107931,2022-07-09,,"I bought it for the dog because it was a move and the dog became noticeably worried, he began to be afraid to stay at home alone, constantly whining, they began to give pills at first. The dog liked the taste, he chews himself. The size of the pills is not large. So far they have positive reviews"
92,107931,2024-01-11,Nothing works,"The dog has almost finished a bottle, but it has no effect at all."
93,107931,2022-11-18,,"Dogs have the habit of taking quiet moment, this ingredient is relatively mild, and they go to sleep after eating."
94,107931,2022-12-29,,"Easy to use packaging, the dog takes the ball happily. After a week you still don't feel any change, let's hope that later on."
95,107931,2023-10-16,Excellent,"Looks high quality, convenient packaging, enough for a long time, the dog likes the taste."
96,107931,2023-10-11,Sedation for the dog,Very good ingredient good taste the dog ate it really nicely good size enough for a long time
97,107931,2023-09-29,Great,This is the second time I order. The dog likes it. I became calmer. I will order again
98,107931,2023-08-15,,"The dog has become calmer, he sleeps less actively at night (doesn't run around in his sleep and doesn't whine) 🙂"
99,107931,2023-06-19,Excellent!,Our dog liked the taste. Worried about it. I'll add more about efficiency later.
100,107931,2023-06-14,,"Dogs love it, but it's unknown how well it works."
101,107931,2022-11-28,,"I have been using this brand, the dog is very healthy"

103,107931,2024-01-07,,"The dog doesn’t want to eat it and avoids it. If it eats it, it will spit it out."
104,107931,2023-08-20,,Eats with pleasure. So far I don't see any effect. But I hope it helps
105,107931,2023-07-22,,"The quality of the product corresponds to the declared, my dog eats it well. The effect is subjective, we will continue to take it."
106,107931,2022-08-20,Ok,"The smell of the snack was already the first obstacle with our checkers beyond the fact that he did not connect to the snack, when he had already eaten I did not see any effect on him"
107,107931,2022-08-19,,My dog likes it very much. It is relaxed and comfortable without being hyperactive.
108,107931,2022-10-02,,"I just ate it for a while, but I haven't seen the effect yet. I hope that it will improve if I continue to eat it."
109,107931,2021-12-19,,Two of my three puppies don’t like to eat
