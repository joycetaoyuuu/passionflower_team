0,20582,2012-05-25,Excellent Product,"I've been taking MyoCalm PM for a few years now.  I started on the advice of my chiropractor.  This product is the best source of Valerian.  I take it with some Bluebonnet Nutrition, L-Tryptophan, 500 mg (also the best source for this product).  Herbalists & apothecaries throughout the millenia have used a combination of  Valerian & catnip as sleeping & relaxation aids."
1,20582,2011-04-01,Great product!,This product works great for anyone who needs a little help relaxing to fall asleep due to minor muscle aches and pains. It states to take three but I found 2 work just fine for me and it's non-addicting as well. I even take it if I'm just having difficulty falling asleep. I would highly recommend this.

4,20582,2011-04-06,Does not work,"I have insomnia where I can't fall asleep at night. I've taken three capsules of MyoCalm P.M. on two different occasions, and it had no effect on my ability to fall asleep whatsoever. I was wide awake, and I had to get up in the middle of the night to urinate after drinking all the water it took to swallow the pills!"
