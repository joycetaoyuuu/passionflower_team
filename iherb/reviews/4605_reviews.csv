0,4605,2024-08-21,Good product,"Definitely helps with better sleep and recovery.  According to my Garmin, it significantly increased the time for the deep sleep phase and REM phase, especially in the summer heat when good sleep is hard to come by."
1,4605,2024-07-17,,"it is good, but not as good as the other ones in this brand "
2,4605,2024-01-08,Good,Quality is good work well before sleep and the benefits from it are good no taste nor smell and the product packaging is good too
3,4605,2023-11-23,Does nothing ,This product does absolutely nothing to help. Waste of money.  No improvements felt
4,4605,2008-05-21,I call this my CHILL PILL !,"At the beginning of menopause I was beginning to lose it.  I had such high anxiety, irritability, mood swings.  My doc put me on prosac which I hated.  I asked a health food store what I could do naturally and they recommended HTP-CALM.  I am now on the other side of menopause and 6 years later I am still taking it.  I've always been hyper with my mind racing a zillion miles an hour and with it I am more creative, focused and a happier human.  If I miss a dose I can tell right away because the anxiety returns.  I love this stuff!"
5,4605,2008-02-18,nice without side effects,"I tend to suffer from moodiness associated with hormones, and living in dreary Vancouver where it rains over 300 days of the year really doesn't help with my outlook sometimes. 

I was taking St. John's Wort for a while, but after about 6 weeks, I only noticed some improvement, but no much during my ""hot"" days when I ovulate and several days priror to my period. 

I've been taking this for about 4 weeks now, and I had the mildest pms in recent memory. I was a tad irritable, but nothing like the godzilla I can turn into sometimes. 

I also sleep so much better while taking these, and it's nice to not be groggy or feel blunted if one is taking a sedative. It's also helped with anxiety associated with stress as well.

The bottle came with the inside seal open (most likely stuck on the lid and pulled off when I opened it). Iherb answered my email very promptly on a Sunday no less, and without hesitation sent out another bottle. I can't say enough about this site and the amazing products they carry. Thank you!"
6,4605,2006-12-20,Best product I've found hands down !,"I have seasonal depression which can hit me extremely hard and the doctor tried different anti-depressants however they make me more depressed after continued use and extremely tired and unable to function.  I've tried other 5-htp brands and nothing compares to this brand.  My particular blend is one capsule with two additional st. john's wort (1x a day) and it works great for me.  No anti-depressants needed !   If I forget to take it I can tell within a couple of days, so I know it's really working for me with my winter blues (SAD)."
7,4605,2010-05-18,HTP.Calm - so far so good,"I am taking HTP.Calm as a replacement for a mild anti-depressant I quit taking since it made me drowsy most of the time.  The HTP.Calm seems to keep my mood up, but I'm not as tired.  I'm taking about 3 a day.  I only had the wild dreams that have been reported once."
8,4605,2010-09-12,Helps me sleep,If I can't sleep I take this. Works every time. Even after my husband died it helped me sleep when nothing else would. Tho I sometimes took it more than once a night at that time.
9,4605,2009-06-30,a tool to help you calm your mind,I've used HTP.Calm for years. Love that it has no side effects. I sleep better and I suspect it keeps my weight from getting out of hand as well. Thanks!

11,4605,2008-11-01,Love it!,I love this product! Within a few days I was able to tell a difference in my mood....I'll never use prescription drugs again!
12,4605,2008-10-08,HTP Calm,"I don't need to take prescription drug;Buspar anylonger because this works so well for general anxiety.It also, help stablize mild to mod. depression(clinical)."
13,4605,2008-09-17,5 HTP Calm,This product has worked well for my anxiety.  It was shipped just as I asked it to be.  I will order from you all again. 
14,4605,2008-03-08,Great Product,I use this to ward off anxiety and it works as well as a RX.  Much safer than drugs and works as well - it's a keeper.
15,4605,2007-03-27,Still the best herbal anti-depressant formula!,"This is the best herbal anti-depressant formula I've found.  It helps tremendously with seasonal winter depression, and also with the depression associated with particularly stressful, overwhelming times in life.  "
16,4605,2009-07-22,The best 5HTP,"I have tried others, but have come back to HTP Calm as it work best for me. I sleep better, feel better, and definitely am more calm. I won't be trying others again. This is the one for me."
17,4605,2008-08-21,Natural Balance HTP.Calm,"I originally bought Natural Balance HTP. Calm to help my anxiety.  I had been taking Effexor XR prescribed by my doctor for 3 years and decided to get off because I did not like taking medication.  I gradually stopped the medication and started taking HTP. Calm and felt very well, it actually has also helped me keep my weight down as well. I would recommend this to anyone. It's natural! "
18,4605,2007-10-15,Works Great,"I used this about 10 years ago when I went through a divorce and had some depression.  It worked wonderfully, can't say enough about it.  Just recently, I moved and could tell I was started to get a little depressed, I googled to see if it was still around and found it at iherb and still works wonderfully.  Within a week I started feeling the weight of depression lift.  "
19,4605,2010-07-14,Just not good for me,"My friend told me she would be taking these for the rest of her life and swears by them, however, something in them made me very sick.  Two weeks of stomach problems and now nothing since I stopped taking them.  I must be allergic to something in the mix.  I was bummed. "
20,4605,2009-10-21,I am using it since 2002!,I highly recommend this product as a replacement for pharmaceutical antidepressant.
21,4605,2009-03-09,Sleep Enhancer,"Take it before going to bed at night, no drowsiness in the a.m."

24,4605,2011-04-25,Natural Balance HTP Calm,I suffer from minor depression.  I have found Natural Balance HTP Calm to be very effective as a non-prescription antidepressant.  
25,4605,2008-03-04,"Great product, great price",truly relaxes me and keeps me on an even keel.  
26,4605,2008-12-21,Didn't Work For Me,This did not work for me and I seemed to have difficulty sleeping when I took it. Serving size is 2 capsules but I only took 1 to start out. Since it seemed to disrupt my sleeping I never did increase it to 2 caps. 
27,4605,2007-10-30,works for me,Helps with my insomnia and mood.
28,4605,2011-02-20,Be careful of your supplements,This product did not work with my body chemistry.  It made me sad and depressed instead of calm and sleepy.
29,4605,2021-02-04,"I'm sure it's fine for some people, just not for me","I'm sure it's fine for some people, just not for me.  It made my thoughts spinny and heightened my anxiety.  "
30,4605,2018-02-22,Not Very Effective On Me,Iâ€™ve found something else which works better and more natural: Gaia stress response and Himalaya ashwahgandha
31,4605,2019-11-30,not helping,not helping
32,4605,2024-08-19,first time purchase,"This is my first purchase. When I received it, the packaging was normal and there was no strange smell. I am currently taking a look at the ingredients. The advantage is that my sleep condition seems to have improved, but my mood and stress are difficult to test. I will repurchase after eating."
33,4605,2024-05-03,"Stabilizes mood, good effect",It has a good effect on stabilizing my mood. It keeps my mood stable throughout the day so that I can deal with the next things. It helps me a lot and improves my stress resistance. The quality is very good. Two pills at a time.
34,4605,2023-12-08,My mood has stabilized!,"This serotonin is easy to use, economical and very helpful for mood stability and sleep!"
35,4605,2024-10-03,,"I feel fine after using it. In addition, there are taboos on this ingredient that need to be paid attention to, which are quite common in life."
36,4605,2024-07-29,,"It doesn't seem to be of much help to me. There is no big difference after eating it a few times, and my mood is not helped."
37,4605,2024-06-26,,"A must-have for sleeping, suitable for both men, women and children."
38,4605,2024-02-28,,It is very helpful in relieving stress and improving sleep quality. Take one pill before going to bed for a good night's sleep.
39,4605,2023-11-21,,It needs to be taken three hours before going to bed. The effect is good and the energy becomes very good.

43,4605,2018-06-10,Great thing!,"Works on all 100%. Relieves nervous tension, gives the opportunity to fully sleep. At the same time, there is no inhibitory effect, as in sleeping pills. No addiction to the drug. I'll take more."
44,4605,2021-01-03,,"Not a bad combination of St. John's wort and 5-HTP. When combined with other sedatives, it helps me to balance and fall asleep easier at night."
45,4605,2017-04-15,I did not get anything,"Maybe I drank the drug not long enough, but after one packing I did not notice any soothing effect, even on the contrary - in the evening I often happened to be in a rage and rushed at people. It stopped immediately after the reception. I assume that some of the components of this remedy do not suit me. Although in general the composition is good and should give a synergistic effect. I will try mono drugs to determine the ""black sheep""."
46,4605,2020-12-21,,no effect
