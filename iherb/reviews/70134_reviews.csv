5,70134,2024-02-22,Not just for kids!,"At the suggestion of my naturopath, I decided to try an L Thianine supplement. Because I have a super sensitive system and medications tend to hit me hard, I decided to start with a kids dose to see how it went. This has been such a game changer for me. I've been taking it when feeling generally anxious and it seems to stopping the anxiety spiral in its tracks. Highly recommend!"
6,70134,2024-01-29,,"It is an amino acid that is obtained from tea leaves. But the point is that when we just drink tea, we get only a small amount of thianine, since it is strongly bound to the molecular structures of the tea leaf and ordinary brewing is not able to completely release it into solution. Only harsh boiling conditions at elevated pressure, when the water temperature rises to 127 ° C, allow the extraction of thianine into solution. And this tyanine increases stress resistance, cognitive (cognitive) abilities, promotes concentration, improves mood. Tyanine begins to act about 30 minutes after ingestion and its effect lasts about 5 hours."

30,70134,2023-03-14,,"I myself study the children's brain and work with special ( including ) children. I see how much the new generation is cognitively reduced, there is no memory, motivation, attention, imagination, cognitive activity, how their nervous system is overloaded from birth with touch stimulants ( constant gadgets, noise, an abundance of bright useless toys...)
Interest in the theanin is due not only to the breadth of its neuro- and general biological effects, but also to the ability to show a positive effect for a variety of diseases combined with very low toxicity ( LD50 > 4000 mg / kg ), good tolerance, lack of development of addiction and other side effects. After taking the teanin, the child has a relaxation, productivity improves under stress conditions, learning ability, ability to concentrate attention and anxiety decreases!!! 

I share a personal RECCEPT for children with hyperactivity \ increased excitability \ reduced cognitive sphere
This drug with L-theanine + Omega3 + Mag + vitamin D 

Let all the children be healthy and calm!!!!!"

I appreciate that it's a natural and non-habit forming option. Since I started taking L-theanine, my sleep quality has improved significantly. I fall asleep faster, stay asleep throughout the night, and wake up feeling refreshed. It's a game-changer for achieving a restful and rejuvenating sleep!"
38,70134,2023-05-20,,"These actually work! My son has autism and sometimes has meltdowns. I tried these because he is obsessed with dinosaurs and they are all natural. I don’t use any  prescription medications for his care. If my son seems agitated I typically offer a “dinosaur chew”. He likes them and chews them independently, they typically work as a distraction at first but they definitely do help calm him down. My other son is not on the spectrum, he tried one once and said it made him feel tired. The quality of the product is great, they are never broken and I trust the ingredients. I keep them in the fridge just so my son doesn’t have access to them. "

42,70134,2023-09-03,Unsure,"Seems to help my daughter to fall asleep sooner. But I’m not sure if it’s doing anything for her anxiety. Some days she seems calmer, but other days she acts out still and has her attacks. It’s great that she can chew it b/c she can’t swallow pills yet. "
43,70134,2023-06-10,,These fun dinosaur shaped chewables are great quality and taste. Perfect for everyday or occasional use. Check the ingredients and see if you would like them too.

44,70134,2023-05-19,,My 9yo has been taking these since she was 5yo on and off when needed. We started off with them to help her shut off her thoughts at nighttime. Right away we noticed the difference in how long it would take her to fall asleep. We have since given them to her whenever needed at nighttime and sometimes in the morning so she can focus better at school. I would definitely recommend these to any parent with a child with an overactive mind.
45,70134,2023-03-17,,"My son has been using these for years when he needs help wtih anxiety.  He is now 14 and still they are helping him feel calm when there is a lot of stress. I try to use natural products rather than medications, and this is one we keep on hand."

I'm not sure this helped, but she looked much better.

102,70134,2023-09-29,Hard to tell,"The dosage of the ingredient l theanine is pretty low per tablet. I tried doubling the dose and it was hard to tell, but I like to think it did help with sleep.  Taste is pretty good. One complaint, it also has magnesium citrate, which is not mentioned until you really scrutinize the fine print. And it doesn't say HOW MUCH magnesium is in it. So I don't don't what dosage of magnesium my kids are getting. Because if this I will probably look for a different l theanine supplement next time. "
103,70134,2023-04-21,,"Honestly, I had trouble getting my kids to take this product. I had high hopes, love the label, love the ingredients, but they would not take it for some reason. I am assuming the taste but I was never able to get a straight answer. I think it's a good product but maybe just not for us. "
104,70134,2022-01-07,,"I like how it Relax-a-Saurus L-Theanine Blend tastes sweet (just the right amount that is) because I tried it myself. I can also feel that it helps manage my mood and I can see how well my daughter is responding towards it.

110,70134,2023-10-16,Fun ,My daughter loves using the designs to imagine she is eating specific Dino’s . It is a fun quality in the design . However she doesn’t particularly like how hard they are to chew. So she tends to suck on them a bit till they are softer 
111,70134,2023-09-02,,Amazing for adhd. Great for making kids fall asleep. Works well as a calmer. Behavior started to change after taking these chewables. I recommend for kids because it works well to calm your child down. 
112,70134,2023-05-12,Good mix of calming vitamins,These are good value and have a great combo of calming ingredients. I tried them and didnt mind the grape flavour but my (fussy) daughter wasnt a fan. I think most kids would like them though. They are quite big though
113,70134,2023-06-06,For kids,We are just trying this now and have checked with our child's allergist who said should be okay to try for relaxation. We are hopeful it will help with getting to sleep.
114,70134,2023-01-26,,"Great taste, fun shaped tablets. I haven't noticed a huge difference, but I am interested in trying again to see if we have more luck."

153,70134,2024-03-24,Texture is no good,"Daughter has autism and while the taste is fine, she spits it because she hates the texture."
154,70134,2022-10-18,,This has helped our youngest when he’s acting a bit wild.  I even recommended it to a friend and she said it worked for her youngest child as well.  He enjoys the taste
155,70134,2022-09-24,,"I didn’t expect the taste to be so good. The only thing is that there’re only 30 chewables in it, and I’ll have to order a lot. Otherwise, amazing product! "

159,70134,2022-01-19,,"I think it is too sweet, but my kids love it. I am not sure of the effect yet.

Update: This is my 2nd order. My child has difficulty falling asleep on some nights and she finds this helpful when she struggles."
160,70134,2021-12-30,,Ok these actually work great  for my 7yr old she didn't go to asleep but it did calm her on a very stressful online class day she was able to focus and calm herself with just one of these and some breathing exercises. 
161,70134,2021-12-06,Nice taste,"I enjoyed the taste of these. Not sure if they did anything but hey if you like grape lollies, you might like the taste of these. "
162,70134,2023-09-14,,"helps to calm but if takes them consecutive days, may have diahhrea for sensitive stomaches"
163,70134,2023-09-06,,I think these helped with my stressed out hyperactive child to find his balance. a bit chalky tasting
164,70134,2023-08-16,,Unfortunately my kids didn't like the flavour. I tried it - tasted fine. Personal taste thing
165,70134,2023-07-06,,"Tastes good, helps with mood and take the edge off "
166,70134,2023-05-10,,helps my son relax a bit more. easy to use. 
167,70134,2022-11-22,,"Great for kids, not 100% sure they made a big difference though I think its a good placebo"
168,70134,2021-06-08,,"Great grape-flavored chewables for kids. L-theanine is a unique amino acid found naturally in the tea plant. L-theanine promotes relaxation and healthy cognitive function, supports vascular health, improves memory and energizes creativity. L-theanine works as an activator of brain activity, but does not cause excitation of the nervous system. I recommend this product!"
169,70134,2021-01-10,Make going to school easier for my son.,"My son always have anxiety going to school even its the same pre-school he went to for the last 2 years. The problem is always the morning getting ready and going to school. In school he have no problem with teachers, friends and education. Ever since taking this in the morning after a short battle of getting him to shower and after breakfast, he is more relaxed. He is more calm on the short walk to his pre-school. Usually he will try to stall for time by saying he wants to sit at the garden first or wants to play at the playground first. And even during the temperature and physical screening before school, he would not cry. Right after that he would hug, say bye to me and happily following the teacher to his class. His mood have been tremendously improved."
170,70134,2018-03-15,It helps !,My 7 years old son has ADD. 2 days after we started to give him this product the teacher said he is more concentrated. Of course it is not Ritalin but there is some improvement and it is stable for 2 weeks already. Also he is less sensitive to social conflicts at school. Please pay attention that it is written to give a pill each 4 hours and also 1 pill daily. It is confusing. My son is more concentrated at the first 3-4 lessons so i suppose 1 pill daily is not enough. And there are only 30 in the bottle
171,70134,2017-11-28,Great Product,"I order this product hoping it will help me calm my son down. My son has ADHD and he is all over the place at times. He has been on it for a couple of weeks and it has calm him down some. It does help him sleep better as well. I will continue to order this product, because it has worked better then other products that I tried."
172,70134,2021-09-21,Wow!,"I was desperate, my 6-year-old son had nightmares and woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep.  
I use these gummies along with some essential oils at night for a good night's sleep and it works!"
173,70134,2022-09-06,,"No dramatic effect, but still a good value for chewable Theanine . I prefer the calming gummies with b6 and magnesium but they have less Theanine. "
174,70134,2022-10-23,,"The flabour is quite abhorrent, so my kids weren't willing to continue taking it, and they really tried, since they love vitamins etc. A pity."
175,70134,2021-06-29,"Good reviews, decided to try ","I am an adult that struggles occasionally with general anxiety. I decided based on all the great reviews to try adding this to my vitamin regiment for anxiety symptom management. Tastes okay. Haven't been taking it long enough I guess to know if it works or not, but, I haven't felt especially anxious lately, so, maybe it's the dinosaurs! LOL 
My friend who struggles with occasional panic attacks ordered himself some as well to try. "
176,70134,2021-03-27,,Great for my son who has light ADHD my only worry is it tastes so good the kids keep trying to get into the bottle when I am not around...🤣 so have to keep it somewhere safe. But the effects are good when small doses are given at the right time.
177,70134,2021-02-08,Softly relaxing,"Good taste just like watery grape juice in a Rocket powdery candy way. Not overly sweet. My 13yrs old sensitive to textures and strong tastes likes it and I bet almost every kid would. It seems to be lightly softly relaxing an effect. He eats it right before sleep. Not a sleeping pill by any means. He doesnt ""feel"" different when he takes it vs not take it, it just seems to settle down and let himself drift off a little more easily. It seems a very organic way to relax."
178,70134,2019-11-07,cannot tell if they are working or not...but my girl asks for them,i bought these for my girl- shes 7- she loves them. it is difficult to day if they help or not. she has a lot of mood swings.... but she asks for them- maybe she feels they are helping her some how. she told her friends about them....she believes they make her stronger and smarter.... ( which is very positive) ehehe...at least it can be placebo effect....really i cannot tell.
179,70134,2023-08-03,,never really helped my kids to relax. I wouldn't buy again
180,70134,2023-04-16,,ok quality product not bad just started will update after testing for some time
181,70134,2023-01-22,no result ,I don't see result or effect for my 5 years daughter .
182,70134,2022-10-23,,"My kids have sensory issues, and didn't like the tablets. "
183,70134,2021-11-17,,"Help my little guy settle his body at bed time (he has ASD). Doesn’t make him fall asleep, just settles his restless body. "
184,70134,2022-07-01,,It’s cute for kids but doesn’t taste very nice so won’t be repurchasing this. Quality is average for this. I use this to help my kid calm down 
185,70134,2021-06-14,Tastes great!,"These taste good and only contain 50 mg of L-Theanine, whereas most brands give you at least 100 mg. So this is better for children and people who want to take it in smaller amounts. I just wish they gave you more than just 30 chewables!"
186,70134,2020-08-10,Good result,I noticed a good result when my son started using the product. You can concentrate better and deal with frustrations in a more balanced way.
187,70134,2019-06-28,Benefical!,We have definitely noticed benefits with our daughter using this product. Less anxiety and able to calm down much quicker when she gets overwhelmed. Will always have on hand from now on! 
188,70134,2018-10-30,Super effective!,"I gave this to my kids every morning after breakfast before going to school. It helps their mood, calm and focus on what they're doing in school. I hope they will lower the price a bit without changing or taking out some ingedients. "
189,70134,2017-10-03,Effective,"My (adult) sister is going through a lot of stress lately, and keeps on asking me for more ""dinosaur pills"". Relaxing with no sleepiness effect. Ordering more."

218,70134,2021-02-25,,I buy this for my daughter for anxiety with adhd. So far it helps to mellow her down a bit if she’s over anxious. The taste is nice too. I’m only giving it 4 stars because it’s quite pricey for the amount provided in the bottle.
219,70134,2021-02-06,,"Don't see any change in my kids' behaviour. 
Tastes good. 
Dinasaur figures a little bit more fragile than traditional animal shaped lozinges. Couple out of 30 were broken. But that's ok. Kids still like the shapes. "

300,70134,2021-01-17,,Kids love the flavour
301,70134,2024-06-10,To suppress some of the emotional ups and downs,"My child has a developmental disorder, and his emotions are very up and down. Once he gets tired of something, it's hard for him to return to a neutral state, and both he and I had a hard time. I thought, ""Let's give it a try!"" I started taking it for two weeks, and he's become a little less hesitant to go to school in the morning, and he's able to walk without pulling on my arm. It may just be a timing thing, but I think Relaxsaurus is also a factor. It has a light, sweet grape flavor. Unlike Ramune, it takes a little time to dissolve in the mouth, so I have him lick one pill a day when he wakes up in the morning. The recommended dosage is one pill every four hours, and not more than six pills a day. L-theanine is said to be effective against tics, but I feel like it also has a slight effect on children's stuttering. The shape of the saurus is cute, and when my favorite dinosaur appears, I get excited, so I enjoy drinking it."
302,70134,2024-04-19,helpful,"I read the reviews and found out that its ingredient is L-theanine, which provides nutritional support for normal and healthy relaxation and mental functions, so I bought it and tried it. Only give food to children who are too excited to fall asleep. This will make it easier for them to fall asleep."
303,70134,2024-03-27,I liked it.,"

This specially formulated blend of L-Theanine (chamomile, green tea and passionflower) is formulated to provide temporary relaxation support, ideal for children. L-Theanine is designed to provide nutritional support for normal, healthy relaxation and mental performance. The chewable tablets are made from a delicious concentrate of real grape juice and sweetened with xylitol for healthy teeth and gums.

304,70134,2024-02-09,A great supplement ,"It was ordered to support the child's nervous system. She takes it before going to bed. She started to say that she began to see dreams, and in the morning she told them. But our main victory is the victory over nocturnal enuresis! I highly recommend it to those who have the same problem."
305,70134,2023-12-08,great supplement,"This is an amino acid that is obtained from tea leaves. But the point is that when we simply drink tea, we receive only a small amount of theanine, since it is tightly bound to the molecular structures of the tea leaf and ordinary brewing is not able to completely release it into solution. Only severe boiling conditions at elevated pressure, when the water temperature rises to 127°C, allow theanine to be extracted into solution. And this theanine increases resistance to stress, cognitive abilities, promotes concentration, and improves mood. Theanine begins to act approximately 30 minutes after entering the body and its effect lasts about 5 hours."
306,70134,2023-12-07,,A good children's complex for relaxation with theanine and a complex of herbs. Theanine is a good basic supplement for calming the nervous system without causing drowsiness. Supplement in good form in a small dosage for daily use. The additive has a cumulative effect. I give it to children at night
307,70134,2023-11-12,A useful supplement,"Good evening. I bought it on the advice of a nutritionist and a child therapist. My daughter started to have a nervous breakdown, often blinked her eyes, so we were advised to drink something soothing, take away cartoons and surround her with positive emotions. We felt better after drinking the whole jar. Vitamins in the form of dinosaurs - the child really liked it, she wanted to choose the figure herself every time. The quality is excellent.

362,70134,2024-09-25,,"I recently purchased KAL Relax-a-Saurus chewable tablets for my child and I would like to share my thoughts on the product. First of all, the dinosaur shape of the tablets is very eye-catching! My child was delighted to have to take the “dinosaurs”. It really helps make the process of taking vitamins more fun. The grape flavor was also great – sweet but not too sweet. My child enjoys chewing these tablets, which is a big plus since it can be difficult to get children to take supplements. As for the effect, I noticed that after taking Relax-a-Saurus, my child became calmer and more balanced. These tablets really help reduce stress and anxiety, which is especially important during school hours or before important events. The packaging is convenient and compact, making it easy to take the tablets with you. The dosage is also clear and simple, which makes it easier for parents. The only thing worth paying attention to is the child’s individual reaction to the supplements. We have not experienced any side effects, but it is always important to monitor your child when introducing new foods into their diet. Overall, I am very pleased with KAL Relax-a-Saurus and would recommend this product to any parent looking for a way to help their child cope with stress and anxiety. It is a great and tasty option for emotional well-being!"

Then the neurologist prescribed another nootropic - the result after a month of taking it was zero, then another one was prescribed and it was recommended to consult a psychiatrist. And psychiatrists treat it with neuroleptics from which the child earns addiction and new sores. I did not give anything else from the pharmacy and ordered these dinosaurs. We drink for the second month along with magnesium and vitamin B group. The result - after 3 weeks there are noticeable improvements, now the tics are completely gone, mood has improved, anxiety has decreased. The taste is excellent. I definitely recommend.

The child loves reading, puzzles, but by nature he is very active, mobile, a lot of energy. In addition, I moved to a new class in developmental programs (classes are more difficult, other older children). I wanted to help him 1) easier to adapt 2) relieve the nervous system 3) easier to go to sleep. There is an effect. the tablets are pleasant to the taste, they can be crushed in a spoon, diluted with water (if they do not eat pills, like we do). Helps with age-related crises. There is no lethargy, lethargy. It seems that there is more perseverance. In the morning I give gamk, in the evening this theanine and separately - magnesium.

700,70134,2021-10-23,,"The first time I ordered this theanine for my daughter at the beginning of the year and now it is our constant purchase. The supplement comes in the form of 4 different types of dinosaurs with a grape flavor. We both tried them :) What can I say - they are awesomely tasty, we really liked them! Every time my daughter chooses with interest which dinosaur to eat;) My girl is very sensitive, she takes everything to heart and she needs a lot of time to get used to the changes. I give her this theanine during periods of increased stress, as, for example, now - adaptation in a new kindergarten, sometimes 2 times a day, morning and evening. In my opinion, the additive has an effect, because I notice that my daughter more easily perceives certain difficulties associated with adaptation. Do not expect a child with severe anxiety to become calm in the blink of an eye when taking theanine, it has a mild effect and its effect in such cases is not enough to achieve the desired result. If the psychoemotional state of your child causes you fear, do not wait and do not try to fix everything by taking dietary supplements, be sure to first consult a specialist (neurologist / psychologist), because the problem (if it exists and is not dealt with) not only will not go away by itself but will get worse over time. Health to your children! P.S. In the photo, on the left, the old design of the jar, since August it has been released in a new one (in the photo on the right)."
701,70134,2021-05-25,Excellent,"I think 50% of parents, or even more, are faced with children's tantrums and whims after the age of 2 years, and we are no exception. Our hysterics reached the moments when she tortured herself and the others, all red, puffing, screaming, fighting. We went to a neurologist, drank drugstore syrups, but they give a temporary result. Therefore, I began to look for something more effective here, these vitamins were advised, since they can be taken from 2 years old, a very good composition without side effects. For our age, you need to take 1 piece per day. The child has become calmer, there are tantrums, but he quickly calms down and does not bring himself up. Patience and strength to parents, the age of 2-3 years is not easy)) Especially with active and characteristic children."

What can we say about a child who has a hard time with himself in this situation ... The first time they began to take in three years, when they went to the garden. And lo and behold, the child became calmer, more adequate, more sociable! I bought it for the second time when I was 4 years old, when, again, with a trip to the garden after the pandemic and the summer, problems began with daytime sleep and falling asleep at night. And again, the miracle dinosaurs helped us. And now we fall asleep easier. And emotions do not overwhelm my daughter so much, she began to control herself and express herself more in words, and not in crying!"
703,70134,2021-01-21,Reduces cortisode levels,"L-Theanine is a potent stress-induced cortisol inhibitor. If you take L-theanine sublingually (dissolve under the tongue, like these), then it is absorbed faster into the blood and therefore lower dosages give the desired result. This theanine at a dosage of 50ml is equivalent in effect to theanine 200ml capsules. Theanine significantly lowers cortisol levels, but only 3 hours after ingestion. Dinosaur-shaped tablets are chewable and do not quickly dissolve in the mouth."
704,70134,2020-10-18,,"The child has Tourette's syndrome. I give this complex on an ongoing basis, along with magnesium and a probiotic. I notice a significant decrease in tics, better concentration, and the ability to complete written assignments more calmly. Reduced anxiety. There are very few drugs for children working in this direction. At the same time, they do not make a vegetable out of the child, but influence gently, without disturbing the general condition. And not having terrible side effects."
705,70134,2023-08-31,,"My daughter really liked the taste, a cool shape of a dinosaur. We drank only one jar, the effect seemed to be quite good, I think it is necessary to take longer to consolidate the result"

708,70134,2023-07-05,,"I was worried about my child's restlessness, so I bought it, but he didn't eat it because of his unbalanced diet. I also eat when I want to relax. The taste is delicious."
709,70134,2023-05-04,Good!,"The little one got these vitamins, I can't say whether they really help, but they worked psychologically - he calmed down. Would I buy again? - I think so. Cool idea with dinothematics, pleasant taste, and natural ingredients👍🏼"

720,70134,2022-10-13,,"I bought this drug on the recommendation of a doctor, as a sedative for a child, because he suffered from a nervous breakdown. The child ate these tablets with pleasure, they have a pleasant fruity taste. The most important thing is that the child's anxiety disappeared, the nervous breakdown, and he slept better. The package is just enough for month of reception"
721,70134,2022-08-08,,"Acquired for my daughter 3.6 years in advance before entering kindergarten for easy adaptation. The first week in the garden brought with it a poor night's sleep and a more precarious emotional state. I started to give half a pill at night, my sleep improved significantly and my daughter became calmer. They taste slightly sour with a grape aroma, but my daughter gnaws them with pleasure. An effective drug at an affordable price."
722,70134,2022-02-28,Excellent!,"Cool L-theanine, it’s a pity that there is so little, but I liked the taste and it’s very easy to drink. My son loved them very much.

The packaging is beautiful. The smell is pleasant. Very happy with IHERB products. If you liked my review please like it!"
724,70134,2022-01-27,Dinosaurs are cool but we don't see the effect yet!,"Really pills in the form of dinosaurs: there is a stegosaurus, tyrannosaurus, brachiosaurus and pterodactyl. Delicious, the kid liked it. But they did not see any calming effect. We have a hyperactive child, 3.6 years old, a boy. Tried everything. Magnesium has minimal effect, melatonin helps at night, but there is still day. Accidentally came across L-Theanine, attracted that in the form of dinosaurs). At first, she was afraid that a small child could be put on soothing pills, but after picking up the literature and studying the issue, she calmed down. Theanine is extracted from ordinary tea, it stimulates mental activity and relieves nervous excitement, that's all. I don't know, maybe someone is helping, judging by the reviews. But if our son is relieved of anxiety - it is in the sense that he is now without worrying does harm :)))) And screams without worrying about our reaction)) We take two weeks) And the energy of the sea at the same time. Calm zero. If I see the cumulative effect later - I'll add an asterisk)."
725,70134,2022-01-26,"Good, but there are nuances in use","My son is almost three years old and he behaves like a classic three year old. We began to visit the garden, where it remains only until lunch. Against the backdrop of the garden, the son refused to sleep during the day, and if he does not sleep during the day, his behavior and the quality of night sleep worsen. The first time I gave a dinosaur along with vitamin D in the morning and did not see any effect. The next day it so happened that I gave the vitamin three hours before his daytime sleep, well, which should be on schedule and lo and behold, the child climbed into my arms and fell asleep. whose child had to put down for 40 minutes with songs, dances, jumping on a fitball. It was something incredible. If you give a pill three hours before a night's sleep, then sleep improves, there are no awakenings, nocturnal cries and other joys. Dinosaurs are pleasant to taste, the child takes them with pleasure, they are different in the package, the child is just crazy about this supplement."
726,70134,2022-01-05,,"Now children have an active life and a lot of work, therefore, from time to time, children take theanine so that their body can cope with physical and mental stress, take 1 piece per day (I give a course once a year) when I see that the child's body needs help (when children refuse to do everything ) after taking, everything goes active, cheerful and happy"

After the reception, she became noticeably calmer and more balanced, it began to really come to an agreement with her. In addition, the daughter became more attentive and assiduous. This drug helped us a lot!"
729,70134,2021-12-09,,"I expected the child to be calmer. It turned out a little the opposite. I saw a stimulating effect, as a side effect of it is speech. More precisely, not a side effect, but a desired effect. A child with speech underdevelopment began to chat right in such a hunt. Right on the 3rd day, I noticed that he was talking all the time. Yes, the letters are bad, the endings ... but it was already possible to start a dialogue. That is, the child has a desire to talk. Well, something like this. I recommend it unambiguously, but definitely not as a sedative."
730,70134,2021-12-06,,"I really liked this supplement, as it has helped my son a lot in his activities, promoting improved concentration in studies and school tests.

I hope the review was helpful and liked (smiley) Thank you!"
736,70134,2021-10-19,,"I order a second time, the packaging has changed. the first time she gave a course, the effect was noticeable already in the first week of admission. the child is 2.5 years old, spoke separate words, began to talk in phrases. sleep got better. the child chews them with pleasure, the taste is not harsh, like zinc or vitamin C."
737,70134,2020-11-24,L-theanine mild sedative for children,"I took the supplement for a 3-year-old child. With the onset of summer (and the beginning of the kindergarten holidays), my son's night sleep dropped sharply. He began to wake up early - before 6 a.m. 30 tablets are in a translucent plastic bottle. Pale pink chewable tablets are made in an attractive form for a child: sweet dinosaur animals with a grape taste melting in the mouth. You can also chew them, it all depends on the child's preferences. Specifically, in our case (deterioration in the quality and duration of sleep), the son takes L-theanine from KAL according to the scheme: 1/3 of a dinosaur pill a day before bedtime. And that was enough for him. A positive result appeared already at the end of the first week. L-theanine does not act as a sleeping pill, but significantly improves the quality of sleep. The child now sleeps more peacefully. The second point, which I will note is a breakthrough in speech. The son spoke in full sentences."
738,70134,2023-09-03,,"Didn't see any results to be honest. The daughter ate 3-4 tablets a day, but still it was difficult to go to bed and slept little"

742,70134,2023-01-20,,"The complex is not bad, the child is a little more attentive, maybe a little calmer, but it does not have a wow effect. I recommend giving for prevention"
743,70134,2023-01-14,The taste was easy to eat,I bought this because I wanted to clear my head during the day. It tasted like grape flavored ramune and was delicious. I wasn't sure if it was clean.
744,70134,2022-10-16,,We drink l theanine and also ordered a children's drink for the children. Here is a safe dosage. They heard explosions overhead and really want to support their nervous system after that. Such is the Ukrainian reality..
745,70134,2022-06-19,Excellent!,"We dealt with adult nutrients for the nervous system in the previous post. And what about our CHILDREN? The child's nervous system is particularly vulnerable due to its immaturity. After the nights in the basements, the sound of sirens and explosions, frightened parents, adaptation to new conditions, began to appear serious problems with children's emotional state - fears, insomnia, hysteria, agitation, hyperactivity. Add to this the age crises and growth spurts 🤦🏻‍♀️ ⠀ 🦕Therefore today it will be extremely important to introduce you to the RELAX-a-SAURUS complex for mild correction of children's nervous system 🦖with excessive overexcitation of tearfulness, hyperactivity 🦖 with increased nervousness, aggression , inappropriate behavior, hysteria 🦖 with high loads and stress 🦖 with sleep disorders 🦖 with nervous tics 🦖 with speech delay and low concentration 🦖 with age crises and growth spurts The main active ingredient is the amino acid L-theanine, which is taken from green tea leaves. It acts as an activator of brain activity, increases stress resistance, relieves nervous excitability. 1 tablet contains 50 mg of L-Theanine + relaxation mixture: chamomile, green tea leaf extract and passion flower (or passionflower) and a little magnesium citrate. What is the wonderful amino acid L-Theanine for children and adults? ✔️capable of largely controlling emotions. Theanine reduces nervous tension without causing drowsiness; ✔️theanine works as a relaxant and at the same time ""enhancer of attention"" ✔️reduces the level of excitability and irritability ✔️improves mental and speech activity ✔️helps in the process of adaptation and habituation to change ❕L-theanine does not act as a hypnotic, but significantly improves sleep quality in the form of delicious dinosaurs with grape flavor. You can gnaw or absorb (better to absorb). Give in the morning on an empty stomach Age 2 years + Course 1 month It is recommended to combine intake with magnesium, omega 3 and vitamin D3"
746,70134,2022-05-26,,"I give the child 4g, I like the composition, there is no allergy, some kind of inappropriate behavior too. I give half an hour before meals.

747,70134,2022-05-15,,"I ordered it for my son who has autism, who is very nervous and has a fickle mood. Its ingredients are excellent and natural. It tastes sweet. I am wondering. I want to benefit from it."

751,70134,2021-05-07,Prescription for children with nervous excitability!,"I myself study children's brains and work with special (including) children. I see how the new generation is cognitively reduced, there is no memory, motivation, attention, fantasy, cognitive activity, how their nervous system is overloaded from birth with sensory stimulants (constant gadgets, noises, an abundance of bright useless toys ...) Interest in theanine is due not only to the breadth of its neuro- and general biological action, but also the ability to show a positive effect in a variety of diseases, combined with very low toxicity (LD50> 4000 mg / kg), good tolerance, lack of dependence and other side effects. The child, after taking theanine, develops relaxation, improves performance under stress, improves learning ability, ability to concentrate and decreases anxiety !!! I share a personal RECIPE for children with hyperactivity / increased excitability / reduced cognitive sphere This drug with L-theanine + Omega3 + Mag + vitamin D May all children be healthy and calm !!!!!"

The child after the reception becomes calmer, but at the same time active and cheerful. I decided to purchase L-theanine from KAL for my 8 year old hyperactive schoolgirl daughter. In our case, it helped. I see the result - irritability, emotional leaps have decreased, concentration of attention during lessons has increased, mood has improved, sleep has improved, absent-mindedness has disappeared. I do not use it on a regular basis. They started taking with half a tablet, gradually increasing the dosage. I also plan to finish the appointment smoothly, when necessary. The effect is cumulative. Hard, sweet, chewy, pale pink dinosaurs that melt in your mouth. You can also chew them. The taste is pleasant, the smell of grapes. Opened packaging should be stored in the refrigerator. There were no adverse reactions while taking. Excellent mild sedative. Recommend! If the review was helpful, rate it!"

I used it for a week, but that week was the worst I've ever had (laughs), and I had a tantrum at school once a day.

877,70134,2018-11-16,"Very tasty, but the effect is not understood","First, there is not much theory about L-theanine, an amino acid that is rarely found in food. Amino acids are the molecules that make up protein - the main building material for our body. Structurally, L-theanine is identical to the amino acid L-glutamine. It can overcome the hemato-encephalic barrier, and thus affect the chemical processes in the brain. It is found in tea and in some mushrooms, but only in a small amount. It was isolated from tea in 1949. It is used to relax muscles and improve attention. Does not cause drowsiness and is not a sedative. This combination of beneficial properties makes L-Theanine much more beneficial than stimulants such as caffeine. I decided to take the child, because he is very hyperactive and still often crying because of any nonsense. Dinosaurs came very tasty, beautiful. Solid, but chew easily. Store the opened package in the refrigerator. I did not understand the effect, as the child will eat them and walks happily. Requests more. Apparently for the course you need more than one."

930,70134,2021-12-30,,"L theanine improves cognitive performance, strengthens the immune system, and can also improve mood. However, it does not have a sedative effect and does not cause drowsiness.

I will not buy any more. if the child is fussy, it is better to look for another form."
932,70134,2021-10-11,Chewy dinosaurs 🦕 🦖,"Great dinosaurs with grape flavor. My daughter loves to chew them, but does not know how much they help her in her studies 👌 She is a very emotional girl, she took it for the period of school days, as she needs to be focused and calm in her studies. Does not cause drowsiness. It gives relaxation to the child's body, while it does not inhibit mental activity."
933,70134,2021-09-23,,"L-Theanine is a potent stress-induced cortisol inhibitor. If you take L-theanine sublingually (dissolve under the tongue, like these), then it is absorbed into the blood faster and therefore lower dosages give the desired result. This theanine in a dosage of 50ml is equivalent in effect to theanine 200ml in capsules. Theanine significantly lowers cortisol levels, but only 3 hours after ingestion. Dinosaur-shaped tablets, they are chewable and do not quickly dissolve in the mouth."
934,70134,2021-09-15,,"Excellent dose for children. It is my second purchase and I recommend it to my daughter with ASD and ADHD. Her attention and concentration greatly improved.

935,70134,2021-08-08,,"It is a very good remedy for calming children, especially for hyperactive children. There are very few such funds for children, such a composition. Improves sleep, calms the nerves, less tantrums, hyperactivity decreases, the child becomes more assiduous, shows interest in some quiet games, to study. You can drink before going to bed, you can in the morning, we drank in the morning, all the same there is an effect on sleep too."
936,70134,2021-07-28,An excellent result in a short period!,"The adolescent son became nervous, inattentive, especially at the end of the school year. I bought this drug and already on the 3rd day the child became calmer. After 2, Ned became more attentive. The second course was drunk in combination with omega and magnesium. Repeated every 3 months. The new school year was much calmer. The tablets are pleasant to the taste, they must be kept under the tongue, since rapid absorption occurs through the salivary glands and the maximum concentration in the blood is reached after a short period of time. Thus, the desired effect of taking the drug is quickly achieved. I recommend to buy."
937,70134,2021-05-22,Good L-theanine,"We give the child 1 tablet in the morning. The supplement was purchased on the recommendation of a specialist for a 3-year-old child. Complaints included: bad sleep, tantrums, tears for any reason, aggression. The child loves dinosaurs, so there is no problem with taking them - chewable hard tablets in the form of dinosaurs with a taste of grapes, melt in the mouth. We noted a positive effect - the child became noticeably calmer, problems with night sleep disappeared (he used to wake up with tears)."
938,70134,2021-05-03,,"They gave it several times so as not to abuse it. The effect was. But the effect is not instantaneous, but extended. For example, for this we took, to extinguish the upcoming emotional overload in connection with the guests. It is necessary to give in advance and the holiday will be calmer. Didn't cause drowsiness and lethargy, everything is the same, but without hysterics. Whether it is possible to give on an ongoing basis, I do not know, I am not going to, only one-time for the case."

1296,70134,2021-01-27,Gentle but effective,"RelaX-A-Saurus, L-teanin is a gentle sedative without sleeping pills. The chewable lozenges in the form of various dinosaurs contain L-Theanine, chamomile, passionflower and tea leaf extract. L-Theanine is an amino acid derived from green tea. It is known for its positive effects on the brain: it increases concentration, reduces tension, fights irritability and gently regulates the general background of mood, without causing lethargy and drowsiness. L-Theanine has proven itself well in adult supplements and has long enjoyed well-deserved success, but children's drugs with this active ingredient have been missed once or twice. Dinosaurs KAL have a pleasant grape taste (thanks to the concentrate of natural grape juice), xylitol is used as a sweetener. When taken in the recommended dosage, they have no effect on the gastrointestinal tract. In my case, dinosaurs have proven themselves well in the use of both a neurotypical child and a child on the autism spectrum - it reduces anxiety and contributes to normal falling asleep and a reduction in nighttime awakenings (not as a hypnotic, but rather similar to tryptophan). We have been using the drug for several years, we have not noticed any side effects. Also, from the pros, I want to add that I did not notice any allergic reactions to this additive in a child prone to atopic dermatitis."
