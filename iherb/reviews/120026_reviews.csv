0,120026,2024-05-28,Sleepless no more,"Since taking these capsules I have been assured of a decent nights‚Äôs sleep, only waking once instead of several times. I find three capsules to work best. They are rather large but slide down with plenty of water and have no taste. I think they are good value for money and will replenish them regularly."
1,120026,2024-05-28,Great Sleep Aid!,"Melatonin does nothing to help me sleep, so years ago I found Force Factor Somnapure. The combination in this sleep aid helps me to stay asleep better than any other product I have found.  However, you should be warned that the size of the tablets is fairly large and the smell and taste is very earthy, so don't leave it in your hand too long or lingering in your mouth.  The dosage is 2 capsules but sometimes 1 is enough to help me sleep.  I believe this is a quality product with good ingredients.  "
2,120026,2024-09-15,Effective Sleep Aid with Natural Ingredients,"""I‚Äôve been using Somnapure for a few weeks, and it has definitely helped improve my sleep quality. The combination of melatonin and botanicals makes falling asleep easier without feeling groggy the next day. The tablets are a good size and easy to take, and the dosage is just right for me. However, it took a few days for the effects to become consistent. Overall, a solid product for anyone needing a natural sleep aid."""
