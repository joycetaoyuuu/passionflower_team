0,106752,2024-04-23,helps my child fall asleep,"It does the work, help my daughter fall asleep faster.
Without this, she would go to bed late and lay in bed for almost an hour before falling asleep.
Now she takes one gummy bear, lays in the dark and falls asleep within 20 minutes. 
She didn't like the taste at first, as these are very sweet, but after a while it grew on her and now she loves it.
Will buy again."

2,106752,2024-01-12,Love the taste,"My son loves the taste of these, he says they’re like peach iced tea. Never complains about taking them and is now getting an extra hour of sleep every night. "
3,106752,2024-01-06,,My 9 year old takes this and is asleep within half an hour. I was paying $50 aud a month for his melatonin and this works just as great
4,106752,2023-12-06,Works great,I wasn’t sure if it would work but it does and completely changed my daughter’s sleep schedule. She’s more well behaved now because she actually gets sleep
5,106752,2023-10-21,The best,"My kids love the flavour of these ,great size and only need to take half before bed to help with their sleep. The cost is good and good quality for money. Happy with Ingredient list too. "
6,106752,2023-01-10,Excellent for adults as well,"They taste great, like melon. They use 1.5mg, which I think is fine. Adults can take two of these. They also use a typical herb blend with passion flower, camomile and lemon balm, which can help with relaxation and sleeping. Moreover, they use sweetener instead of sugar, in case you don't want to brush your teeth after taking them every time, or in case you rely on low-carb food. Great product."
7,106752,2024-03-23,,"My grandson didn’t really like the flavour but he is fussy. He prefers the strawberry flavoured, they seem to help him settle and sleep "

10,106752,2023-06-26,,"Works so well for my daughter to get to sleep - she is 6 and normally bed time would take 1-2 hours, now within 20 min she’s out. We then gave her half the amount and then a quarter and still successful! She also lives the taste. Highly recommend if appropriate for your child. We did get a paediatricians opinion too."

64,106752,2024-05-08,very good,"#1 Vitamin Gummies Brand 1.5 mg Per Serving Helps Kids Sleep Sleep Support Non-Addictive No Addictive Drugs Sugar-Free Dietary Supplement Melatonin works naturally with your child's body to support sleep. What's in: Melatonin Passionflower Chamomile Tangerine officinalis What's in: No high fructose corn syrup No artificial dyes (FD&C) No artificial flavors No gluten, dairy or sugar

"
65,106752,2024-09-13,Fall asleep quickly,"Purchased for children and adults. Melatonin becomes ineffective if taken regularly, so I only eat it when I really need it. The taste is tropical fruit and not bad. I like the chewiness, which is a little harder than fruit juice gummies! Even picky children eat it easily. Both children and adults get sleepy and fall into a deep sleep within 30 minutes of eating it. There is no waking up in the middle of the night. When my child ate 1mg melatonin gummies, they would often wake up in the middle of the night, so this is very convenient and good!! Adults can fall asleep easily by eating two, so I will definitely buy this again!
"
66,106752,2024-04-04,"Tastes good, kids like it","I have had many symptoms recently, such as pain, weakness, sensitivity, etc. The body is the foundation of everything. As the mainstay of a family with elderly parents and young children, I have a responsibility and must pay attention to it. The future direction of medical care will shift from biomedicine to functional medicine. Study hard and be a doctor for yourself and your family. Thanks to the IHERB platform, not only is the quality good, but the ingredients are clear. There are many high-content, large-volume, and low-priced products to choose from. Make all practices and implementations easy. I want more people to understand and use it."
67,106752,2024-03-09,Looks like it's easy to eat,"My 9-year-old boy was going to the hospital because of his severe anxiety, but it became difficult for him to go to the hospital, so I bought this as a talisman. At the same time, she bought several melatoning gummies, but she said that this flavor was her favorite. I feel like I'm asleep within an hour.
"
68,106752,2024-01-24,I always order from the company Hairev for my children and for myself the most powerful and confident and naturally very satisfied,"I am very satisfied with the quality of the natural and useful products that I order from Hayrab, I know it is safe, fast delivery, thank you
"
69,106752,2024-01-21,Perfectly!,"The quality is good. The advantage is that it contains not only melatonin, but also calming herbs: passionflower has a very good effect on the nervous system. The dose is not harmful, suitable for children. The taste is excellent, the child likes tasty jellies. After them, the child falls asleep quickly and sleeps peacefully all night. Contributes to the general calming of the nervous system, the child is not so overexcited during the day. But the price is too high."
70,106752,2023-12-31,Prominent,"I brought it for my children, but I am the one who started taking it to help me sleep healthy and peaceful and without worrying in the middle of the night, knowing that I have insomnia and sometimes I drink coffee. However, it helps me sleep easily"
71,106752,2024-09-18,,"I bought this melatonin for my children to establish their sleep patterns after the summer holidays. I like the quality, the ingredients are working, the dosage is just right for children, the taste is pleasant)"
72,106752,2024-05-06,I fall asleep like a child,"Really like. Changed the label. I barely found it. I take it all the time. In addition to melatonin, several other herbs are present. Individually they don't work for me. And together it's a super combo. "
73,106752,2024-04-15,Is delicious,"When he eats this, he falls asleep immediately. I was worried that he might get too excited and have trouble falling asleep, but he still falls asleep, so it's a relief."
74,106752,2023-12-27,1.5mg of melatonin in one gummy,"I think this product is recommended for people who don't want to drink extra water before going to bed. The effect was the same as that of capsule melatonin, and I was able to sleep soundly."
75,106752,2023-10-23,Looks like it was delicious,"Even though it's a supplement, it's delicious and easy to eat, and the size is just right, so I thought the ingredients were safe and the quality was high."
76,106752,2023-11-03,First purchase,"This was my first purchase after being introduced to it by a friend. The bottle is difficult to open and close, so I am using it after transferring it to another container. Melatonin seems to decrease when exposed to sunlight, so I store it in a dark room (on a shelf). I bought it at the end of September and started using it for a month, and I'm still not sure about its effects, but I think I'm able to fall asleep better than before after using it in conjunction with a sleep inducer. Still, in my case, I wake up midway."
77,106752,2023-03-26,,"It is very excellent for children and does not cause any allergies or problems, provided that the child’s age is correct. It is preferable to consult a doctor as well, and it is not used daily. It is sufficient when needed only. Yes, I like the product very much"
78,106752,2024-07-08,helps,It helps my kids to calm down. Very good product 
79,106752,2023-05-19,,"It is sweet and beautiful, and its ingredients are excellent. I give it to my children for three or four days, one at a time, in order to gradually control their sleep, then I stop it for the time of need..half an hour while they sleep deeply and are not like other types. They sleep for two hours and then wake up. Even I take it when I need to adjust my sleep. Although it is written that it does not cause addiction, I prefer the more you do it .. Make me happy with a like 😊"
80,106752,2022-11-19,,"I feed my ADHD daughter. I've tried a lot of melatonin gummies and supplements, but they seem to be the best in the past! The grain size is also small. Compared to other melatonin mimes, I fall asleep immediately after eating, probably because it contains 1.5mg of melatonin. I want to repeat!"
81,106752,2023-09-03,,"With my owl kids, like mom, it's sometimes really hard to get everyone to bed on time. Especially when you have to go to school or kindergarten, so such an ingredient as the sleep hormone, melatonin, is a big advantage for me. The dose is usually one candy, which has a pleasant taste, so there are no problems with taking the drug. Thank you Iherb for the quality and prompt delivery!"
82,106752,2023-06-09,It's a taste that children like ♬,"Since it contains fruits, my child loves fruits and gummies, so he will happily eat them. The only problem is that I can't get it until I go to bed because I can only get it before I go to bed at night, or maybe because it's special. When you eat it, you will naturally go into sleep mode, so it's good to wake up in the morning. I like that it has no side effects and that it is a supplement rather than a medicine. It looks like it's easy to eat with a feeling of size that children can hold in their hands. I want to repeat"
83,106752,2022-11-12,Very good! !,"My daughter, who used to only choose Zerby's, liked it! It's the same 50 grains, but at the current rate, this one is cheaper and delicious! There is a condition that the child must be 4 years old or older, but he slept without problems! I was worried about how it would affect melatonin, which is a little more than 1.5mg, but it wasn't too effective, and I woke up refreshed without any drag, so it's good! I want to buy again!"
84,106752,2024-10-19,,"Great product, good for those who need it, useful when needed, easy to use, good smell, good quality "
85,106752,2024-10-17,,"Wonderful product, just like everything offered on this site, I highly recommend it"
86,106752,2024-08-21,sweet,"Regulates children's sleep, especially after vacations. Give it to them until their sleep is regular."
87,106752,2024-06-09,Good taste,It tastes good and helps children fall asleep quickly. But the melatonin content is slightly high.
88,106752,2024-05-09,Super ,"I bought the jellies for myself, a better alternative than tablets, after two I fall asleep like a baby in 30 minutes"

The grains are small, and it was good that they were happy to eat it with the scent of fruit. As a parent, I was attacked by a pleasant sleepiness 15 minutes after eating. It seems that 2 grains are just right for my child who is hard to work."
102,106752,2024-08-30,Good,"Very tasty candies but the texture is dense and hard, my daughter can't chew it. Good quality and sweet peach flavor"

105,106752,2023-08-19,,"Terrible for all the house, young children take it, and adults two to 3 pills, and it sleeps without any side effects, headaches or lethargy. Finish and order a second taste of delicious peach"
106,106752,2023-08-07,very good,"I feed the kids when they have jet lag when they go on a trip. In addition, sometimes I can't train myself, and I find that eating a pill is also effective for me."
107,106752,2023-07-23,,"Melatonin has been proven to help you relax and fall asleep on time. Relieves nervous tension. The taste is pleasant, the dosage is excellent. I took it for myself, not for the child. The doctor prescribed exactly the dosage of 1.5 mg"
108,106752,2023-04-22,,"It helps to sleep well, but I advise not to give it to children on a daily basis, only to regulate sleep every once in a while, and I recommend it for children with hyperactivity and autism"
