0,5229,2023-12-20,,"Nature's Answer Passionflower Aerial Parts Fluid Extract, available in a 1 fl oz (30 ml) bottle with 2,000 mg of extract per serving, is a supplement derived from the passionflower plant. Here's my review:

Passionflower Benefits: Passionflower has a history of traditional use for promoting relaxation and easing stress. It is often sought after for its potential calming effects on the nervous system.

Fluid Extract Form: The fluid extract form allows for quick absorption, making it a convenient option for those looking to experience the potential benefits of passionflower without the need for capsules or tablets."
1,5229,2023-11-30,settles my anxiety,Thanks for offering a quality product that works and does what it's supposed to! taste isn't the best but I generally put under my tongue for a few seconds and swallow so it's not sticking around for long. I take a long with lemon balm capsules and it works so so well at calming my anxiety. Package seems small but I use about a half of dropper 3x a day so it's lasting me awhile. 
2,5229,2024-09-07,Good product ,Haven‚Äôt tried yet so not sure is it really good to be honest. But this brand been around for long time so I trust that the quality is okay 
3,5229,2024-07-29,,"I have been dealing with anxiety for so long and my therapist mentioned Passion flower extract. This brand has more quality than others, more intense so you‚Äôre getting higher dosage in small amount. Taste is good "
4,5229,2024-06-03,Passionflower,The size is perfect to keep with you add to your water and get dosage to your water to get benefits of natural anxiety relief. No taste
5,5229,2024-01-02,"Nature's Answer, Passionflower Aerial Parts","Nature's Answer Passionflower Aerial Parts may support relaxation and ease occasional stress. With natural compounds that may interact with neurotransmitters, passionflower is traditionally used to promote a calm state of mind. Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on using passionflower for your specific needs."
6,5229,2023-11-13,Helps put me to sleep ,"I love these tinctures. All of them really. No complaints and they are more potent than you think, so only use a few drops a day, no need to mega dose with these "
7,5229,2023-03-06,Great product for calmer night time,"I keep reordering this, so I can always have it when needed. 
I like the taste, and it is definitely working for me when I have troubles falling asleep. I usually try to give my body the time to naturally calm down (removing screen time helps with that), but if there is no success then I go and mix passion flower extract with a but of water. 
My only concern is that one time it made my period to start one week early. I googled and yes, passion flower makes your uterus contract more, so no surprise it happened to me. I consulted with my therapist who said if I only use it no more than once a week, it should be fine. It only happened one time, and now I‚Äôm more cautious and use it only if I cannot fall asleep for longer than 2-3 hours. I usually have just a couple of nights like that in a months, so I believe it is fine. Overall, I think this is a great supplement. "
8,5229,2024-05-21,Not sure if it works,"So far I've been adding it to my herbal tea at nighttime, but I can't tell if it's working. Insomnia still persists. The taste is unpleasant, so be prepared for that. "
9,5229,2023-09-22,Must have,"Passionflower is must have in my medicine cabinet. It works well when I am under a significant amount of stress and can‚Äôt easily calm down. Pure ingredients, good quality and works pretty fast. It does have a strong taste, so I typically drink little bit of juice afterwords. I do know breastfeeding and pregnant women should stay away from passionflower. "
10,5229,2024-09-05,,"Seems good, trust its brand name, and good quality and hope it works"
11,5229,2024-08-04,Really works,Used this to help with anxiety and I noticed a big difference

This is the only extract that helps me when I can't fall asleep"
18,5229,2023-10-18,This is a staple for me.,I bought it 3 times alredy. Not dissapointed yet with potency and quality. 
19,5229,2024-05-21,,Taste is a little bit strong but for the rest is a really good product
20,5229,2023-08-13,,I take a dropperful of passionflower in a glass of water in the middle of the night for when I wake up and can‚Äôt go back to sleep. Seems to help

22,5229,2024-03-16,Helps me to relax before sleep,"Helps me to relax before sleeping, but it tastes terrible! It's hard to get down!"
23,5229,2022-10-08,,"Great for counteracting anxiety, plus I also struggle with insomnia waking me up in the middle of the night and taking it helps me get back to sleep   "
24,5229,2022-05-03,,Calms me down much better than valerian root. Doesn't make me sleepy if taken during the day. however does help to have a good sleep when taken at night
25,5229,2023-09-22,Good ,That very good to help me sleep and relaxe all time minimum stress
26,5229,2023-09-07,Good ,Order it for my father and I think he is quite happy with it üëåüèª
27,5229,2023-04-10,,"one of my favorite supplements, it really works, it's a must have one"
28,5229,2023-04-03,,Great supplement for restful nights! No side effects and a nice slow lull into sleep.
29,5229,2022-11-17,Doesn't help me with insomnia.,"Passion Flower is in many sleep aid supplements so I thought I'd try it alone & in liquid form because it can be hard to swallow capsules & then lie down again, they seems to get stuck in my throat. So while the liquid form is good, personally I discovered Passion flower doesn't help my insomnia. "
30,5229,2022-10-30,,"great supplement, quality brand. very happy with purchase.  will be back for more"
31,5229,2022-01-02,,"I was on an over the counter herb tablet from a pharmacy that contained, amongst 2 other herbs, 2g of passionflower. It was discontinued so tried this. This has a strong tincture smell and texture, wasn't expecting. I believe as this is a mild herb (great it has no side effects), you have to use at least 2g or more for it to work, likely with other things as well like lemon balm. I use it for pmt non sleeping times. Slept better, but not through the night. Using the dosage required, you'd get through a bottle quickly. It is annoying working out the dosage. In my case, I think tablets work better, so I'll try them instead next time."
32,5229,2022-04-05,,"this is a good product except the alcohol taints the flavour for me you might like it.., there is a alcohol-free version and tastes great has a nice flavour you will find that on here aswell"
33,5229,2023-02-26,,Good product.  I bought as emotional support and I feel slightly uplifted using this extract.
34,5229,2021-03-20,obsessed with this stuff. ,"if i wake up in the middle of the night restless, i take a few droppers-full of this straight into my mouth. the taste is absolutely fine for herbs (most herbs taste horrible) and is almost on the sweet side. it calms me down and helps me rest almost immediately. cant live without this!"
35,5229,2020-10-27,,"I have used this product for over three years to help with sleep and also anxiety.  I add it to a small amount of water as I don't really like the drops undiluted under the tongue.   For sleep, I find it far better than Valerian and many other natural products I have tried and to have my mind finally turned off at night is  wonderful.   For anxiety, I find this product both centres and relaxes me.   Please, i-Herb, never remove this product!"
36,5229,2016-11-13,Useful for Anxiety,"I purchased this after reading another review where it was being used as a replacement for Ativan/Lorazepam.  It does work!  Not for extreme attacks - for that I still turn to my prescription.  But for low-grade or when I start to feel one come on, this works very well.  Helps when I start feeling my heart pounding or beating fast.  Because it is alcohol free I can put and keep a dropperful or two under my tongue (acts fastest this way) for several minutes.  I also use it at night, along with kava, to help me sleep - that's when my anxiety seems to come on the worst.  Does it taste pleasant?  No :-)  But, then no herbal things do.  If you are used to taking tinctures you won't find this any worse than any other (and probably slightly better - it has now become the taste of 'aaahhhh').  If you are trying to limit the medication I noted above I suggest giving it a try - you might find it just what the doctor didn't order!

Edit - I've since changed over to pill form as it's easier to travel with and find it just as effective."
37,5229,2014-12-31,This actually works for anxiety,"I've suffered from social anxiety for a long time.  Ironic, considering
I'm also a super social person who loves being around people.

I've tried panicyl, one like this, gaba, and wasted money onmany others.

This has been least expensive and works immediately.  Makes
you a normal relaxed, not sleepy or zombied.  Just the feeling of no
Fear which is awesome!"
38,5229,2012-05-01,John of God,"John of God is a healer in Brazil, he can be seen on Youtube if you dont know who I speak of... well he's truly an embodiment of Love and has healed thousands of people from HIV, Cancer, etc - and this (Passionflower) is the ONLY herb he recommends. Its  a very special gift given to us and I highly recommend everyone take this. When balancing hormones, its important to take something to ""lock in"" the good hormones and passionflower is one of those somethings. I love this and will never look at life without it again!"
39,5229,2010-12-31,Takes the Edge Off," I add two droppers full to some water at night and it seems to just take the edge off.  It doesn't make me drowsy, but it does relax me and thus helps me get to sleep.  If you are a tense or nervous person, I would try one dropper full in the morning as well. "
40,5229,2023-03-27,,I‚Äôm not a fan of the taste of this tincture and I‚Äôve had Passionflower tincture quite a few times. The texture is quite think and honestly I won‚Äôt buy it again 
41,5229,2016-08-02,Sleepless Nights,"I have always had a hard time sleeping at night.  One day I was on the Internet and saw IHerb. I knew about passion flower.  I ordered it, and has been ordering it since. It works fast, no side effects, and I would highly recommend this product. No anxiety, no insomnia, I sleep well at night NOW!!!!"
42,5229,2009-09-22,"Nature's Answer, Passionflower Herb","Love this product.  It is the most effective supplement for sleep that I've tried.  Other brands or capsules of any sort do not work for me.  I would love to see you carry this in the 2 ounce bottle at a competitive price.  (To get a lower price and larger bottle, I have to order this from another supplier who has terrible customer service.  I also have to order Nature's Answer Vitex from them"
43,5229,2023-04-01,,This product seemed to work okay for me it wasn't what I expected though but it did a little bit of a calming
44,5229,2021-03-01,great product ,this is a great product to use daily for calmness. i use it to aid anxiety + menstrual cramps. passion flower is a great go to  herb. i also appreciate the low alcohol content
45,5229,2017-08-07,Great for sleep.... I put it in my tea,I put this in my Yogi Bedtime Tea at night and it makes it taste better and I think it helps the quality of my sleep
46,5229,2012-12-23,sleeping help,"This is a great product to help a person sleep. It's fast, easy and really works. It has a great calming effect and wonderful to use if a person gets a tension headache. It doesn't taste too bad either."
47,5229,2012-03-17,great for peace of mind,"I love this stuff.  I'm sort of the nervous type and Passionflower by
Nature's Answer solves that problem.  Nice taste, just drop in some coffee or even water, juice and you will feel the effects quickly.  This will always be on my shelf."
48,5229,2010-01-26,NO MORE XANAX!,"I have chronic osteoarthritis and am only 51.
  The passionflower vine tincture is amazing.
It relaxes my body not my brain. I feel more
clearheaded, sleep better, and have less pain.
   It works great for me.
Without the alc., it`s terribly sweet. Just me.
  "
49,5229,2009-06-05,A Muscle Relaxant,"Just my opinion, but this herb, especially Nature's Answer's version of it, is an effective pain reliever by virtue of the fact that it relaxes your muscles. I believe this is precisely why it's also good at helping people sleep, even though that is not how I put it to use. Nature's Answer is the best. Tremendous potency. Great bargain, too."
50,5229,2008-12-07,Highly Recommeneded,"Product works 100%. Works great and calms you down. I have bad nerves but try to stay to something natural. This works, but I find your body becomes immune to it with time, so I cycle this or Valarian Root. Overall great product."
51,5229,2007-12-14,Helped me sleep,"I took about a dropper before bed and was out like a light all night. Even the cats on the bed didn't bother me!  It has a rather strong taste, something like thick licorice."
52,5229,2007-12-11,quick acting,"I use this product to help with anxiety.  I also use the capsules, but the tinctures work quicker. I keep this in my pocketbook for those times that I might need some quick help."
53,5229,2022-09-27,,Less stressed and sleep better. High quality product with good ingredients. 
54,5229,2022-04-30,,"This product works wonders at allowing me to sleep much, much better!!"
55,5229,2022-04-28,,Worked well - better then the pills from same firm and better then my tea. 
56,5229,2022-02-21,,This works better than the capsules for insomnia and to relax tense muscles.
57,5229,2022-02-08,,"I am using this drops almost every day before work, it‚Äôs helping me to be more calm "
58,5229,2021-11-05,,Great for anxiety and insomnia! Try it! You won‚Äôt regret it!
59,5229,2021-09-12,,It works wonders when you can't fall asleep. I fell into a deep sleep after taking a dose. The taste is herby but not too strong. Diluted it in a little water.
60,5229,2018-06-27,Good quality ,"It's really good for relaxing the mind and body, very calming.  But you have to take quite a bit, and then it can make your bowels loose.  But if that is not a problem then several droppersful are necessary to do the trick."
61,5229,2017-10-06,Great for nervousness!,"Tastes good, works well. Very handy to keep in your bag, the dropper system is very convenient and the formula doesn't require you to chase it with water. Highly recommended!"
62,5229,2014-09-23,Ok... for sleep,"This was recommended to me to help get to sleep, so I tried it nightly (mixed in chamomile tea to give myself the best chance I could). I think it does promote relaxation, but it's subtle. It's not as powerful as melatonin or other tablet sleep aid/supplements, but I would be surprised if it's habit-forming, so I guess it's a trade-off.

Take this, stay out of blue light in the evening, and read a little of a good book as you want to fall asleep and it might be enough for you."
63,5229,2020-02-14,Works for me,I have been using this product for more than a yr and it does help me sleep. Whether this  is the best product I couldn't say because I have not tried another brand .
64,5229,2022-10-12,,Seems like a quality tincture but didn't quite meet expectations. 
65,5229,2022-08-12,,Didn‚Äôt really feel much effect but I only used 38drops
66,5229,2018-07-25,Good Quality,"Stronger than the capsules, but I found that passionflower makes my constipation worse me so I can‚Äôt take it."
67,5229,2013-12-14,Absolutely wonderful!,"I take this during exam time, and introduced my dad to it when he developed panic attacks. Can't fault it! Amazing!"
68,5229,2011-11-28,Passion Flower,I use it with Lemon Balm to get my cortisone down to a manageable level. Provides relaxation and calm. Beneficial.
69,5229,2011-10-16,Calming,"I take before bed, helps me relax and get to sleep."
70,5229,2010-01-27,It Works!,"After just a couple of days I felt calmer, slept better, and considerably reduced my anxiety."
71,5229,2009-01-11,Very good.,It works as I was hoping it would==calms the stomach.

80,5229,2021-01-22,,I highly recommend liquid passion flower rather than a pill. You notice an impact right away! 
81,5229,2020-12-16,,It helps to calm the mind and fall asleep faster.
82,5229,2020-12-12,,Like it because of the low alchol. also works great because it's concentrated.

90,5229,2019-12-02,Relax!,I use this at the end of the day as a relaxant. It works for me.
91,5229,2009-02-08,"ok, but doesn't work",I guess the years that I have taken prescription sleep aids and anti-anxiety meds have prohibited me from benefiting from passionflower.  It's too bad; I've been searching for a way to sleep at night without the need for chemicals.
92,5229,2022-08-28,,The best product

114,5229,2009-11-30,Service great but this product did not produce any noticeable results,Nothing
115,5229,2021-06-12,,Minus because of alcohol. 
116,5229,2024-02-18,I use it when I'm depressed or have a panic attack.,"Normally I would use it to sleep, but because I have a neurotic constitution, I use it when I'm depressed or have a panic attack. The ingredients are strong and the taste is bitter, but I like it. The good thing is that if you take it and put it under your tongue, your panic will be cured quickly. I keep using it repeatedly because it's cheap and effective."
117,5229,2024-07-11,Excellent!,"The quality is one of the top, I recommend this product to everyone, the size is convenient for both use and storage at home, the advantage for me, of course, is a good price for this product. the composition does not differ much from the rest of the competitors' products. the packaging is excellent, it arrived without defects and damage, the use is very simple and clear, there should be no questions "
118,5229,2024-06-12,Benefit.,"I love liquid forms of drugs, they are the same liquid as blood and it seems to me that this is why they are absorbed better. Well, this is my personal interpretation of the advantages of liquid forms. I really liked these drops: you sleep great until the morning. The effect has been achieved. I recommend to all! I took it as directed on the package."
119,5229,2024-01-05,,"The passionflower herb from which this extract is made is known for its calming and relaxing properties. It has been widely used in traditional medicine for many years to relieve stress, improve sleep and relieve anxiety.

120,5229,2023-11-24,Herbal sedative,"The quality, composition in general and the ingredient (additive) in particular are good and do not cause complaints. Dosage - a sufficiently high dose compared to analogues (this is a significant advantage over similar products). The efficiency is high, absorption of the drug is good, the supplement is soothing. We accept the whole family (age 30-65 years) for quite a long time (several months), the frequency of admission is constant - courses with breaks. The taste is neutral, there is no aroma, no smell. The packaging is convenient, airtight, whole, large."
121,5229,2023-11-06,"Mild sedative, works faster than capsules","The liquid form of the tincture is an advantage for quick absorption, dissolving in the mouth and swallowing helps to feel stable in stressful conditions. The effect of passionflower is better when you take the capsules for a while. The supplement works gently. The taste of the tincture is pleasant and sweet"

129,5229,2023-09-18,Reduced hyperactivity,"We always have passionflower with us on the road. If the child travels for a long time or is simply in a state of hyperactivity, we always give one third of a teaspoon. We have been using it for more than 5 years - it is very convenient when it is not possible to take tablets or drink capsules with water. Indispensable for giving to a child on the street. And the taste is quite pleasant..."

After the taste is special: not strong in taste but a little bitter. I had to add chestnut honey."
132,5229,2023-05-09,,"My favorite sedative. I take it myself and in stressful situations I give it to the child. It tastes slightly bitter, but pleasant, some kind of woody. Great product because it's alcohol-free. The quality of the products from this brand is always on top. Passiflora has a mild effect on the nervous system. Soothes quickly and safely. It also has a cumulative effect. I will order more!!!"

The method and concentration are different from the passion flower flower essence, but I feel that it is similar to the flower essence because it has a higher absorption rate than supplements. (When diluted with water) I feel that it is quite hard to put directly in my mouth because it is thick."
134,5229,2023-01-16,,"Excellent quality. The bottle is not big. The dosage is taken by the child 1 pipette in half a glass of water. The taste is normal, the child drinks without problems.

I've tried cbd oil and it has helped me relax and sleep better, but it's expensive. I searched for something better and found it. After about 15-30 minutes with a single dropper under your tongue, you will feel more calming than cbd oil. This doesn't guarantee that I'll be able to sleep every day, but when I look at the quality of my sleep on my Apple Watch, I'm getting more deep sleep. It just tastes bad! It has a faintly tangy and sour taste like unsweetened brown sugar, so I try not to taste it as much as possible. Next time I would like to try the non-alcoholic one."

Half a pipette without washing, and in 10-15 minutes you fly to the kingdom of Morpheus! I want to try another version without alcohol."
170,5229,2021-09-15,,"A super sedative and normalizing agent for the nervous system. I have not met analogues in our pharmacies, so that it is alcohol-free and just as effective (and I don't really want to plant the liver, just calm my nerves). Of course, the tool is not the cheapest, because it does not last long, but it is effective. Passionflower has a clear cumulative effect, you just need to use it regularly, maybe not in very high dosages, but on a regular basis. Also, magnesium and vit C help me in a pair, because it is they that burn in our body during stress like on a fire. And their deficiency leads to prolonged stress. So in addition to such a wonderful sedative, it is also important to make up for deficiencies. If an emergency occurs, you can carry it with you (the bottle is small, easily fits into a bag) and just pour a pipette or two under your tongue, the effect will definitely be there. Thank you for appreciating my review and sincerely hope that it was useful to you! :) all health, beauty and goodness!"

I take it with me even on trips, together with a mask and earplugs, it provides me with a comfortable sleep even in not the most favorable conditions."
173,5229,2021-01-12,Mast Print,"It dampens stress and irritation well when covered. I carry it with me in my purse as an express tool (a couple of pipettes under the tongue). It works better if you take any relaxants in courses (passionflower in tablets, valerian, motherwort, etc.). Expensive, but the nervous system is more expensive) Sometimes, when a toad chokes to order, I use an empty bottle for a diluted motherwort or valerian and also take it with me to help with nervous situations."
174,5229,2019-10-30,Passionflower,"This passionflower is what is called the mast hell of a first-aid kit: we use it for nervous overloads.

This is one of my three assistants, along with hot meals and coffee. You just need to know when and what of these three to apply. I add a pipette of a passiflora to a big cup of warm water and I drink. I can drink 3-4 such cups per day. I tried to drink solo, just drip in my mouth under the tongue - I don't like the effect. In warm water is very good."
177,5229,2021-10-15,Good,"Effective and pleasant to the taste, so that there is an effect I take 2-3 times a day, it helps to calm down and put the nervous system in order, the bottle leaks slightly upon delivery"
