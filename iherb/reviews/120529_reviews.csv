0,120529,2023-12-29, I trust the brand,"I trust this brand and the quality of its ingredients, and did see some calming improvement but for my dog it was not dramatic, just enough to take the edge off. I do wish this came in a capsule form just to avoid all the added ingredients to make it into a chew"
1,120529,2024-01-20,Very selective Cat,"Bought these for my 3 yr old cat who is having issues. The quality of the ingredients are very good but she is the pickiest cat on the planet. I cut it in half and sprinkle it on a wet treat to entice her to eat it. Serving size is potent enough, I will keep giving it to her to see if it helps. "
2,120529,2023-12-18,questionable mg,"my cat is 13 lbs so had to try and break in half and it crumbled, she was also hesitant to eat. My concern is the milligram amount-the l-theanine is the same amount that I take and many of the other ingredients seem to be in people weight mg amounts. I will have to contact my vet before I continue with this product even though it says vet designed and tested, shows photo of a dog and it seems to be more for larger animals but I'm not a vet so not sure, just want to be on the safe side. If nothing else I'll give one to the backyard female deer as they are a little wound up at this time of year as it's mating season. "
3,120529,2024-05-07,Ok product,Quick delivery as always. I started giving it to my dog last week and I think that some minor changes are visible- but Iâ€™ll continue giving it to her and see how it goes.

good quality, good ingredients, but not the effect I expected"
5,120529,2024-06-06,"Good. The dog eats willingly. I think it works, but the price is crazy.","I have a 9-year-old large mixed poodle, gentle and emotional. The previous product I bought for sedation worked for him somewhat but he didn't like the taste. He willingly ate the current product - it smelled good; The taste is probably good and it also worked. Still, not sure I'll buy again at that price. I dropped a star because of the price."

7,120529,2024-05-16,Pet Supplements,I heard that mushrooms are more nutritious for dogs. I tried it and it tastes good. Dogs are willing to eat it.
