0,21595,2023-10-24,"My ""Go To"" for anxiety","I've used this product over a period of 20+ years, and while I've occasionally tried other products or pharmaceuticals, I always come back to RidgeCrest Anxiety Free.  The  combination of herbal and vitamin B ingredients adequately controls my anxiety without any apparent side effects or that feeling of being ""drugged"".  It's a surprisingly gentle but effective approach that I've highly recommended to others. "
1,21595,2024-09-02,Find Your Calm with RidgeCrest Herbals' SereniZen!,"I recently picked up RidgeCrest Herbals' SereniZen, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me! The bottle has 60 capsules, which is a solid amount for a month’s supply. The packaging looks nice and is pretty user-friendly. The capsules are a good size—not too big—so they’re easy to swallow. What I really appreciate is the blend of natural ingredients like ashwagandha and rhodiola, which are known to help with stress and anxiety. Since I started taking them, I’ve noticed a significant drop in my stress levels. I feel more calm and focused during my busy days. If you’re on the lookout for something to help manage stress naturally, I highly recommend checking out SereniZen!"
