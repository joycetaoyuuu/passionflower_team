0,120860,2024-08-06,,good melatonin and electrolytes. i recommend it for working out 
1,120860,2024-02-12,Bad taste,"The artificial sweeteners in the drink mix are overwhelming and make the drink taste very unpleasant. I tried one serving and could not finish it. If you know you don't mind how stevia tastes, you might like it or think it tastes decent, but I would not recommend this to a friend. "
2,120860,2024-03-06,Like it.,"Dissolve nicely, Taste great, Not sure if it helps sleeping but anyway the composition is great, "
3,120860,2024-02-02,Bounce back ,Given to me by my sis who is a nurse and I bounced back real quick. 
4,120860,2023-09-30,Great sleep mix,It’s great  combination of melatonin dosage and other ingredients with electrolytes that makes me relax and fall asleep easily. Great package. Just mix it with water in a bottle before bedtime and enjoy

6,120860,2023-09-16,,"Very good and fresh taste, good combination of minerals. Recommend for everyone, because electrolytes are cruel for health these days. And I like that you could drink it before going to bed"
7,120860,2023-08-01,,"great quality 
good ingredients 
tastes good
perfect size for one"
8,120860,2023-07-28,,"well formulated for a healthy quality of sleep, it helps me relax the brain before bedtime and the taste is very good."
9,120860,2024-04-04,I have to drink it before I go to bed,"I bought it with the intention of drinking it during the day, but I overlooked the fact that it was supposed to be taken 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed. I just drank it and went to sleep, and I was able to sleep soundly! The taste is not very fruity, and it's a somewhat sweet Pocari! I don't think it's the kind of taste you would drink before going to bed, but since it's an hour before, I drink it to hydrate myself."
10,120860,2024-09-14,I was still sleepy until the next morning,"I bought this to hydrate before bed, because I heard that electrolytes and water are lost while sleeping. I dissolve one packet in a 500ml plastic bottle of water and keep it on my bed, and drink this drink after taking my bedtime medicine. I tried drinking it twice, and I fell asleep immediately. However, even though I slept for about 7 hours, I still felt sleepy when I woke up the next morning, and I was still sleepy until the morning. Maybe one packet is too much for me. I've never fallen asleep so easily even when drinking nighttime herbal tea, so I think it's quite effective and suits me. However, it makes me sleepy, so I can't drink it during the day. I gave it a minus 1 for that reason. However, it doesn't contain any unnecessary ingredients and is delicious, so I would like to buy it again."
11,120860,2024-10-11,Hydrate before bed,This is the perfect supplement for rehydrating before bed. I think we consume a fair amount of water while we sleep. You can replenish that water with a scientifically designed supplement.
12,120860,2024-08-30,There are no such things,"Every time you re-purchase at the end of an accelerated physical activity, it gives a host of everything the body has lost since the use. It does not suffer from left overs or a headache. A rare product!!"
13,120860,2024-05-31,Repeat!,"My kids love it. When I bring sports drinks to club activities, I use this to keep them hydrated. I'm glad it's safe and secure."
14,120860,2023-12-23,delicious,"I don't usually drink a lot of water, but if you dissolve this in about 500ml of water in the morning, it's delicious and you can drink a lot of it, so you can stay hydrated without even thinking about it."
15,120860,2023-09-09,I tried it right away and found it to be better than sports drinks.,"I've been drinking sports drinks like Pocari Sweat and Aquarius to check my electrolyte and salt levels, but this one doesn't contain sugar, so I can drink it safely even at night. It tastes just like a normal sports drink, and since it can be diluted with water, the cost performance is actually better than Pocari Sweat."
16,120860,2023-08-24,,"Hydration Optimization Matrix™ contains a unique ratio of five key electrolytes, coconut water, and Aquamin® marine complex. Blended with natural cane sugar to speed up absorption, each sip is made to hydrate your body better and faster than water alone. With three times more electrolytes and ten times less sugar than sports drinks"
17,120860,2023-08-24,,"As for the taste, it has a strong sweetness. I don't know what kind of sweetness it is, but is it (probably) the taste of dragon fruit in the package? Personally, I like the taste, but some people may find it too sweet...Sleep, Nighttime, Dreamberry, it has names that sound good to drink at night or before going to bed, but don't worry about it. I drink it as a daily hydration. Maybe it's because of the name, but when I drink it, I feel like I'm going to have a good time. This series has a lot of good points personally, such as the price is cheap, it melts easily, and the amount that can be made in one bag is just right."
18,120860,2024-10-06,delicious,I drink this to hydrate during training. It tastes better than just water.
19,120860,2023-12-19,Fine,Very good! I recommend it and will order again. I sleep and get enough sleep. Just happiness in a jar. But very sweet...
