0,6807,2024-10-13,So cozy,"I love the ingredient blend combination and that includes rosemary, chamomile, lavender and so many more good things that benefit calm and good health. I‚Äôll be getting more of this tea! The taste is mild yet you get a sense of each herb. I‚Äôm drinking a frequency of serving a day. "
1,6807,2024-08-19,Great for my anxiety,This tea works like a charm for me. I love anything chamomile. No caffeine. It doesn't make me sleepy. I never add sweetener because it has a unique taste that I love. Lots of powerhouse soothers in this blend. I love that the tea bags are individually wrapped which means I can take anywhere. 
2,6807,2024-07-06,You want good sleep?,"Okay, if you are tired of taking sleeping pills this is for you! I struggle with insomnia and let me tell you.. 20 minutes after taking this I felt relaxed, fell asleep, and slept like a baby!!! The ingredients are very tasty. I would recommend. My mother also struggles to sleep and this is the only tea that has been helping her. So yummy and beneficial! I recommend! Quality and packing were great. "
3,6807,2024-02-01,I'm a fan,"Traditional Medicinals is a brand that I appreciate for quality and strength. I would love to mix Herbs but it is not possible for me. So when I need herbal tea that might actually be therapeutic from a brand this is where I go.

Comment below if you think there's a better choice. Let's make these reviews even more helpful!!"
4,6807,2024-01-20,Perfect tea,"My daughters and I absolutely adore this lavender medicinal tea. The moment you open the package, the scent of lavender creates a beautiful sense of calm. The tea has a delicate, floral flavor with just the right touch of sweetness that we all love.

Not only does it taste amazing, but it also helps us unwind after a long day. And it truly eases our stress and anxiety. Plus, knowing it's organic and natural makes me feel great about sharing it with my daughters. If you're looking for a delicious and calming herbal tea, this lavender medicinal tea is definitely worth a try!"
5,6807,2024-01-17,Good product ,"Excellent product the quality is good, like so much the ingredient, size and the packaging way good. Normal taste of lavender with mint also the smell. Would recommend drink it daily before sleeping and will help you if you have insomnia. Also other many benefits. No caffeine also amazing in this product."
6,6807,2024-01-12,Really nice for bedtime,"Love the flavor (the one caveat is that if you let the bag sit in the tea too long the flavor is going to suffer). It‚Äôs a nice blend of herbs that deliver relaxation benefits, calming the central nervous system for restful sleep. I will keep this in my regular rotation. "
7,6807,2023-12-02,Loved ,"Good quality and ingredients. Taste great and help with my insomnia, that‚Äôs the real benefit of this tea blend. No caffeine, so you can drink with the frequency you like. 
I drink one serving at night 1 hour before sleep and it‚Äôs my favorite time of the day. 
Really recomend"
8,6807,2023-10-22,"Traditional Medicines, Organic Cup of Calm, Lavender Mint","Traditional Medicinals teas have become a staple in our home, and the Organic Cup of Calm in Lavender Mint is no exception. It's like a warm hug in a mug, and let me tell you, we've got quite a collection of their teas.

One of the things I really appreciate about Traditional Medicinals is their commitment to using organic and high-quality ingredients. It's like you're getting a little dose of nature's best stuff with every sip.

Now, as for the Lavender Mint tea, it's our go-to choice when we need a bit of relaxation, especially before bedtime. It's like a gentle lullaby for the senses. The combination of soothing lavender and refreshing mint is just pure magic.

It's one of those teas that helps you unwind and shake off the day's stress. Plus, it's caffeine-free, so it won't keep you tossing and turning at night."

234,6807,2013-09-28,Easy Now Tea:  One of Key Weapons in My Personal Arsenal ,"In 2007, I gave birth to my son.  It was a completely natural, med-free birth but I had severe bleeding after my son was born and recovery from childbirth was really difficult for me.

I also was hit with overwhelming Post-Partum Depression. During my pregnancy I had had horrible panic attacks for months and the PPD was just an extension of that.  The PPD was relentless and lasted for nearly 18 months.  The first six months I barely remember because it was so bad.  I went untreated because I, nor my husband, were educated about PPD.  Our whole family suffered.

In late 2008, I discovered Easy Now tea.  I was nosing around a Health Food Store in my mother's city and came upon this tea.  I had always been a tea fan so I picked up a box for less than $5 USD.

I've been a faithful consumer of Easy Now since that day and I always have a stash of it in my house.  It has seen me through another pregnancy and the post-partum time and half-way through my Master's Degree meanwhile working full-time outside the home and being a wife and mother to two small children.

When I'm stressed out, overwhelmed or anxious and cannot sleep, I brew a strong cup of easy now and it helps tremendously.  The flavor is very mild and comforting and a bit of stevia included in it gives it a slight sweetness.

I've also used this tea with my children to combat severe jetlag as we live a 16-hour flight away from my parents in the States and it has been such a useful tea to have for that!"
235,6807,2023-06-25,All you taste is Stevia! ,"I was so excited with this stellar line up of ingredients, did not notice it contained stevia until I received it. And it‚Äôs awful. All I taste is the stevia. Disappointed. "
236,6807,2020-12-31,,"Tea bags are compostable which is a major plus, though hope it's entirely compostable, we don't want micro plastics in our tea! 
This tea is light and minty, indeed quite calming if mint is something you like. Good for soothing the stomach after a heavy or oil-laden meal. "
237,6807,2022-05-23,ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤!,"Free caffeine tast delicious use it before sleep 
serving   Delicious tea frequency smell  nice make me relax "
238,6807,2022-05-17,Favorite tea,"Super calming, great tasting, does wonders for my poor traumatized nervous system."
239,6807,2020-12-21,LAVENDER  MINT,"I love this Lavender Mint Tea, I have using it as Iced Tea, this summer was really hot in Vegas so for every tea bag we added a lot of ice cubes and agave nectar as sweetener. the flavor is so good and the family love it."
240,6807,2017-06-24,Great herbalist tea,"Doesn't knock you out like chamomille  does, two cups and you should be fine. I don't like the idea of drugging myself with herbs, but this is the best. Drink more for sleep. "

250,6807,2014-02-15,Marcy,I gave this three stars only for the pleasant taste. I did not know it was going to have licorice root in it and think it should have a warning due to licorice not being good for persons having high blood pressure or heart problems.  I also didn't like sugar free product in my tea even if it was Stevia.  I don't like my tea sweetened.
251,6807,2013-07-17,Herbal tea for evenings,"This herbal tea is soothing. It does not give you an Instant feel of relaxation, but you do calm Down a bit.
