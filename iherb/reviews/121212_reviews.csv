0,121212,2024-06-11,Special Scent,"The best scent in my opinion for this brand. Texture is pretty thick yet easy to absorb. Not greasy even in summer, from the northern hemisphere so it tends to be pretty dry. Scent is rather uplifting rather than calming. I would say moisturizing power is so and so. Won't be enough for cold North winters and it suits the spring summer season. tube is kind of big to carry around so I keep it at home."
1,121212,2024-03-10,I LOVE my ZUM!,"Zum lotions are great. I use the Sea Salt when I'm looking for less of a scent all over my body. When it's the hands or feet, I use the Lavender one which is amazing as well. They are very moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. The natural essential oils in them have a huge benefit and I feel really good using them. The lotion is thicker and applies well. I definitely always have a Zum lotion on me at all times.  "
2,121212,2024-07-25,Love it!,I've never smelled anything like this lotion. Smells very unique and fresh. It's got a great texture and it absorbs quickly. Gives skin a nice radiant glow. Extremely moisturizing and it's a wonderful lotion for the summer time. Wish the bottle was a bit bigger though. 
3,121212,2024-04-16,Body Lotion,I absolutely love this scent. it actually smells more like lemongrass instead of the sea salt. I've been using it everyday. the quality and size is great. it moisturizes greatly! love it!  
4,121212,2024-02-27,One  of ZUM's classic scents,"Perfect size for use as a daily moisturizer.  Sea Salt is one of ZUM's best scents.  This also pairs nicely with their Frankincense and Myrrh fragrance.  The lotion is not a thick body butter.  It has a thinner feel, and soaks into the skin super quick. "
5,121212,2023-12-25,Super Good!,"This Zum lotion works!  I use it daily on my sensitive, dry skin and find it very moisturizing.  The scent is a subtle salty smell.  Perfect for any season.  It offers a pleasant texture.  The lotion is well-packaged.  Totally recommend!"
6,121212,2023-11-26,,This is my third scent I tried. I’m not a fan of this scent it smells to medicine like but the fact that I love the lavender and almond and the way it moisturizes your skin is a plus. I herb was very nice and let me return the sea salt one. All three scents have a nice smooth texture when applying. I will buy the other two scents again 
7,121212,2024-02-08,Moisturizing and good scent ,"The scent is pleasing and not too strong, texture is ok absorbs fast and leaves a light film of protection when dried. Depends on individual, most guys probably won’t like it. "
8,121212,2023-10-08,Great lotion,"This  lotion is light and hydrating. I don't know why the other reviewer said it smells weird and stays strong smelling. It doesn't. If you are used to ""perfumey"" lotions that have have fake scents then you might not go for this. All the scents are from the essential oils and they are really nice.  It's a little earthy (like a slight sandalwood) so if you like flowery sweet smells it might not be your thing. Again, it's very faint after  a while. I love Zum. It's hard to find this price point with quality ingredients. They also use meadowfoam which another expensive brand has with fake perfume stink so I'm grateful this one is natural! :)"
9,121212,2024-10-14,Excellent,"Great consistency, really nice fragrance, and it does a good job as a moisturizer. "
10,121212,2024-09-16,Smells fresh,"Nice fresh smell, feels good on my skin, non sticky, made with essential oils, natural product"
11,121212,2024-08-31,Smells so good,Good product. Definitely meets my expectations. Will be purchasing again in the near future.
12,121212,2024-07-28,Favorite scent,"I love the light, hydrating feel of this lotion. The scent is uplifting. "
13,121212,2024-06-18,Feels and Smells Great,Hands feel soft not greasy. Dries quickly. Smells good but not overwhelming 
14,121212,2024-06-10,Love the smell!,"I have the same scent in room spray for my bathroom as well as candle in my office. Non-toxic, non-overwhelming scent."
15,121212,2024-05-23,Natural and Effective,Good moisturizer.  I have needed  a truly natural hand cream and have found it with Zum.
16,121212,2024-05-14,The best,I was not a regular lotion user until now! This stuff smells great and isnt greasy.
17,121212,2024-04-17,Favorite lotion,Love the scent! Feels nice and smoothly applies without greasiness. Carry it in my purse 
18,121212,2024-02-05,As Expected,"The smell just like the other sea salt products, and the consistency is that of lotion. works as expected. "
19,121212,2024-01-22,Love,I love smell and consistency of this cream. Tube is huge absorbs fast 
20,121212,2023-12-17,,Fantastic for my dry skin! I use it every time I wash my hands. 
21,121212,2023-12-13,Great Hand Lotion,I purchased the full size bottle of Zum Hand and Body Lotion after trying the small sample in the variety pack.  Great lotion!
22,121212,2023-12-13,,"Super yummy, love this lotion! Nice long lasting scent. Great product"
23,121212,2024-05-25,Quality lotion!,"Excellent body lotion, but scent is not my favorite. Very citrus scent."
24,121212,2023-07-03,Smells great but…,"This Zum hand and body lotion smells great but it is very hard to apply and takes a lot of work to rub in. I usually use Beekman 1802 but I wanted to try something different. I have to say, I will definitely be going back to the Beekman!"
25,121212,2023-09-30,,Like the light scent and only need a little product. Absorbs nicely 
26,121212,2023-08-25,,"Overpowering, unpleasant scent. I would not recommend this. The scent still lingers even after I wash my hands and put on better lotion! The smell is also just odd and kind of funky. I don't even know where or when I could use it. It's strong enough that it even bothers my pets, so I can't wear it at home. Waste of money. Definitely don't buy this if you're sensitive to smell or have allergies. "
27,121212,2023-07-05,,"My favorite Zum scent yet! I love the citrusy notes. Beautiful formula, lathers wonderfully! "
28,121212,2024-04-09,refreshing,"It smells like citrus and a little herbaceous. I personally think the scent is not too strong and not too distracting. I just use it at home. The size is not too big and it's just the right size for me to try different things. I use it on my body after a bath or on my dry hands. I think the package design is stylish and nice, so you can keep it somewhere in your home.
"
29,121212,2024-10-14,really like,"It has a very nice scent. Is it musk? It stays on the skin for a while, so you may like it or not. I don't use it on my whole body, but only on parts like my hands, arms, and shins. I have sensitive skin, but I was able to use it without any problems. I don't know yet whether it will be moisturizing enough for the dry seasons of mid-winter and late autumn."
30,121212,2024-08-11,Smells good,"I love the refreshing scent of this sea salt, and I use it in the mist and soap. The lotion is loose and easy to apply. It's moderately moisturizing. I also have the same lotion in patchouli scent, but that one is a love-it-or-hate-it scent. The size is large, so you can use it generously."
31,121212,2024-06-05,Moderately fragrant,"The gentle scent fades relatively quickly. I use a generous amount and apply it to my whole body. It's not sticky, and it doesn't get on my clothes even when I apply it under long sleeves. The brown version of this series seems to be a matter of personal preference, but I think this one is more likely to be popular with everyone than the brown version. It's easy to use, so I'll buy it again when I run out."
32,121212,2023-11-24,My favorite scent. There will be quite a bit left.,"It smells like lime, and the lingering scent is musky. It feels like a men's perfume. I guess it's for summer. There will be quite a bit left. The good thing about it is that it has a texture that is neither too loose nor too hard, making it easy to use. It feels moisturizing without being sticky, so you don't have to worry about it even if you put on clothes right away. As for the ingredients, I trust them because they are ZUM. I would like to try other scents next time."
33,121212,2024-10-08,The scent of the temple,"I bought this because I was curious about what the sea salt scent would be like. I bought this for the first time because ZUM's lipstick, detergent, cleansing products, etc. suit my skin very well, but it smelled like a temple, which I didn't really like. The moisturizing power is fine."
34,121212,2024-06-09,,"The package is quite large, so it's easy to use, and the texture of the lotion is a little heavier than milky lotion. In the summer, it's convenient to apply it to the back of your hand first and then to your arms. The scent is more like lemongrass than sea salt, and reminds me of blue hay. It's very moisturizing, and I like it.

"
35,121212,2023-11-23,Fair enough,"I bought this because I like the scent of the Sea Salt hand soap, but I didn't think it had the same scent, so I gave it one star. It's not a strong scent, but I personally think the scent could be a little more muted. If you just apply it lightly, it will remain white, so you need to apply it thoroughly, but it has a strong moisturizing feel."
36,121212,2024-09-16,Great,"The cream has a light citrus scent with hints of menthol. Very high-quality, chic, pure composition will bring a lot of benefits to the skin. Moderately oily, but very quickly absorbed and does not leave a film, for the spring-autumn season. Instant hydration and aromatherapy. "
37,121212,2024-06-03,good smell!,"I liked the other scent so I bought this one too, and I really like the more refreshing scent. The natural ingredients, size, and price are all good."
38,121212,2024-04-14,,"I love the sea salt scent! It's not sticky, yet moisturizes well, has a light texture, and spreads easily. I would like to use it all year round, so I would be happy if it was a little larger."
39,121212,2024-01-02,It smells good,"I usually use hilloid prescribed by a dermatologist, but I also use it when I want to enjoy the scent. It doesn't sag like hilloid, but it's just the right amount of hardness and stretches well, so you only need a small amount. It's moist but not sticky and easy to use."
40,121212,2024-08-28,,Very good composition. Moisturizes the skin well. Big packaging. The only thing is a sharp smell for me. The smell of essential oils and a little citrus. 
41,121212,2024-07-24,Sea salt?,"At first, it smells like a refreshing mix of herbs, but as time passes, it starts to smell like incense. It's a light cream, but I like how it moisturizes just the right amount."
42,121212,2024-05-17,"Easy to get used to, with a lemongrass-like scent","It spreads easily and is not sticky, but moisturizes. It comes in a large capacity, so the whole family can use it. The packaging is cute, and the texture of the skin becomes smooth. It has a natural scent and is easy to use."
43,121212,2024-10-03,fresh aroma,The fragrance is fresh and quite moisturizing. Sufficient for autumn use. The large one is very convenient for use in the company.
44,121212,2024-09-21,Unsurpassed ,"Unsurpassed! Very high quality, delicate aroma. I recommend it to everyone who appreciates high quality."
45,121212,2024-07-27,Excellent!,Sea salt scent of wounds is very fresh and nourishes the skin
46,121212,2024-07-01,Great body lotion.,"Pleasant to apply on the body, absorbs quickly, gives a good feeling during the day, highly recommended for lavender scent lovers."
47,121212,2024-06-22,,It's very easy to use. The main reason is that the ingredients are mild. It's good for the skin.
48,121212,2024-04-28,,The paint has natural ingredients and this brand is well known. Everything about it is natural without additives 
49,121212,2023-12-27,Excellent!,", the texture is light and non-sticky, and has high ductility. It can be used all year round in Taiwan."
50,121212,2024-01-06,good,They are all my favorite scents and will continue to use them.
51,121212,2024-04-07,,"The scent is not good, just average, will not repurchase"
52,121212,2023-08-25,,"Sweet, I liked it, but it is not wow, but it is suitable for daily use. It smells, I mean, it has a strong smell, but honestly, sweet."
53,121212,2023-07-31,,"The texture is super super wow, but the smell of sea salt here is very citrusy, I will try some other smells"
54,121212,2024-08-03,,It feels like a men's scent.
