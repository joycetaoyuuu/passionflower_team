0,30819,2024-01-24,,"Passion Flower herb arrived in a large, fragrant bag, offering an incredible, fresh aroma. Whether enjoyed on its own or blended with other teas, the taste is delightful. It's my go-to tea evening tea for a calming evening, and the generous size provides excellent value. The quality is noteworthy, and I plan to repurchase again due to its great taste, benefits, versatility in blending, and the soothing experience it brings to my daily routine. The absence of caffeine adds to its appeal as an ideal choice for my evening routine. "
1,30819,2023-12-01,Chillax and rest easy,"This is such an effective tea to settle me down and really bring things down to earth. It’s a great fog lifter from the stress of the day and a nice way to really mellow me out. The flavor by itself is something to get used to, but I’ve found most things like this just become its own thing after a while. It’s like once you start drinking black coffee no sugar. Once you get over the hump, you can start to appreciate other flavors you never noticed before. Some of the foreign flavors in Passion Flower are ok once you get to know them. Also, I mix it with something I enjoy too. It all depends. Good stuff!"
2,30819,2024-10-01,Love This One,"I’ve been enjoying Frontier Co-op’s Cut & Sifted Passion Flower Herb! The calming properties make it perfect for winding down in the evening. I love brewing it into a soothing tea that helps relieve stress and promote relaxation. The 16 oz bag is generous and lasts a long time, allowing me to incorporate it into my nightly routine. It’s a delightful addition to my herbal collection, and I appreciate the quality that Frontier Co-op provides!"
3,30819,2024-03-30,Great Value.,The size of these bags is great. How much of the quality ingredients you get at once..  buying your tea ingredients in bulk is just 100% the way to go. We add about 2 tablespoons per serving to our nightly tea blends for that relaxing benefit. Definitely caffeine free! Not a resealable package. 
4,30819,2024-03-12,Helps me sleep,"My doctor suggested using passion flower to help me stay asleep, which I've been having issues with for years.   This definitely helped!  The flavor isn't the greatest, so I may mix it with other teas that I usually have in the evenings.  Highly recommend it for those who like tea and are having perimenopausal sleep disturbances.  "
5,30819,2024-01-04,Must have for anxiety ,This herb is a must have for anxiety. It is very calming. It has a very earthy taste so it’s best to mix with something like chamomile or peppermint when using as a tea. We use as teas and tinctures mixed with other herbs and it is absolutely amazing. Has great benefits. Will definitely purchase again.

94,30819,2023-07-29,Seems ok but too large a quantity,I don't see why they can't sell smaller quantities.  There's no need for this much and it will likely spoil before I can make use of it.

125,30819,2021-04-07,,"Excellent as a tea, but i find the recommended dose is so low, i usually strain 4g of the dried herb in 250ml boiling water and leave it for 15 mins, take it 60 minutes before bed for improving my sleep. it really works but need several days to notice the effect "
126,30819,2020-04-11,Bulk passionflower herb rocks!,"I find passionflower tea helps immensely with sleep, and teabags with pure passionflower are hard to find, and often sold out. So I took a chance on bulk passion flower herb by Frontier and it is great! Fresh flavor, easy to use - just get a loose tea infuser that holds a teaspoon, and it is same amount as in 1 teabag.  Plus, the bag is HUGE, and price unbelievably low for the amount. Expiration date is so far ahead, I will be able to use this tea for many months without restocking.   I can't praise it  enough! Thanks, Frontier and iherb!"
127,30819,2019-01-12,Excellent quality dried herb,"I use this for my relaxing tea mix. I grow my own lemon balm and chamomile in the summer and add passionflower as I can’t buy the seeds to grow it here in New Zealand, plus the weather doesn’t support it. I’ve been using this herb for a couple of years now and very happy with it. "
128,30819,2021-01-24,"Has a grassy, natural taste. Helps a bit for sleep.","I thought it was fine, it did help a bit for relaxation and sleep but to be honest I have a couple boxed teas (the sleepy bear and another with oat straw, passionflower and hops) that help just as much.  It might just be the ritual of drinking warm tea in the evening that makes me sleepy.  
I do like that loose tea has less packaging and I think it is nice quality."
129,30819,2020-02-21,Product and price...,"Searched everywhere, I'm kinda a geek like that. Best bang for your buck right here. Been buying from iHerb before Amazon was around. I heard from the guy who wrote the book on natural healing, Dr Michael Murray, says a strong cup of this before bed will help sleep."
130,30819,2022-03-08,Absolutely great,I bought a pound. Do you know a pound will probably fill a gallon jar. Thad a lot of Passion flower.

132,30819,2011-08-15,Best for quality,"I used to buy Passion Flower tea bags and decided to give the bulk tea a try. What a difference! It's much fresher and knowing the quality that goes into growing and harvesting from the Frontier website, I feel good about brewing a cup of tea! "

143,30819,2017-10-29,Passion Flower Tea,"Could only drink it with lemon juice as it’s not that great flavour wise. Tried it a couple of times, not sure it it worked as I couldn’t take it for long enough to find out. This was because I had to get up around 4-5 times in the night as it made me want to pee all the time. I take it it’s a diuretic.

144,30819,2021-06-15,"Excellent! Great tea for relaxation, before bed time, etc.",I take a cup of this after dinner with my teenager and we both find that it relaxes us and lets us get to sleep more easily.
145,30819,2021-03-17,,"Helps me sleep, with no downsides. Tastes a bit like grass but brewed with some other strong tasting herb like mint it is quite palatable. I can't tell you how this compares to other brands as this is the only brand I have tried. "

152,30819,2022-07-10,,It helps calm me down ~! Has a herby and grounding flavour! 100% recommend!
153,30819,2017-06-21,Not as good as I remember,"I bought this same packet about 3 or 4 years ago and used it for both smoking and tea - and had better results and tastes than this batch. Maybe it's my new strainer, maybe I'm just brewing it wrong, but it's definitely not as great as I recall. The taste was quite dirty, even adding cinnamon sugar and/or milk to the tea. That said, I do still believe this tea helps with anxiety and sleep issues. Not amazingly mind, but a nice little boost if nothing else. Just be aware it is very, very raw, and might come with a dirty taste if brewed wrong."
154,30819,2023-04-12,Tastes Like Hay,What a bummer! It looks and tastes like hay and now my throat hurts from one sip. Do not buy this product.

194,30819,2024-01-21,It tastes like plants.,"The scent isn't particularly distinctive either. I blend 2 tablespoons of mint tea, 1 tablespoon of orange peel, and 1 tablespoon of passion flower in 600ml of hot water and drink it. It seems to be good for insomnia, but I haven't really noticed much of an effect. I'm looking forward to what's to come."

You can drink it as needed, as long as it is combined with a proper diet, it will be of great help to the body!"
197,30819,2024-05-08,Awesome with chamomile tea in the evening ,"It does not contain caffeine or any stimulant substances, and I noticed the benefit in the ease of relaxation and restful sleep after drinking a cup in the evening, with the necessity of surrendering to relaxation. Do not resist drowsiness after drinking it, surrender to sleep in the evening. In fact, I became addicted to it instead of evening coffee. 
"

201,30819,2024-09-06,,"Frontier Co-op's Passion Flower Powder is a quality product for making calming teas and infusions. The 16-ounce (453 g) container provides long-lasting use, and the product is ideal for those looking for a natural way to relax and reduce stress. Passion flower helps to relax the nervous system and improve sleep. The only downside is that the powder form may require a little more effort to prepare than capsules or liquid extracts."
202,30819,2024-02-16,Expect unique scent and active ingredients♪,"It has a slightly unique aroma, but it won't bother you as long as you don't boil it too much. This can be said about herbs in general, but it seems best to be patient with a slightly smaller amount. If you blend it with other herbs, the scent won't be noticeable, so if you blend it with fragrant rooibos, you can drink it."
203,30819,2024-01-10,Calming taste,"I drink it as a tea. Unlike the familiar taste of Japanese tea, it has a rush-like taste that permeates through your body. In everyone's reviews, there were many people who loved drinking it as a pre-bedtime tea, so I was expecting it to make me sleepy, but I didn't really feel that way. So, I use it as a daily tea."
204,30819,2023-12-19,I feel calm,"As mentioned in other people's reviews, I feel sleepy while drinking this tea. That's not the case with me. I just feel like my brain is calming down. I can fall asleep easily, but I also take melatonin. I don't think it will work on waking up in the middle of the day. The tea smells like grass. The taste is grassy with a slight sweetness. I think there are some people who are not good at it. I'm pretty good at pretty much anything. It's a large quantity so it lasts quite a while. I'll add more if I find other uses. As you pour tea leaves and hot water into a cup and do some errands, the ingredients will come out, so if you're not careful, it will get thicker. Sometimes my brain gets so excited that I can't sleep, so I'll report back if I can drink this tea and sleep."
205,30819,2024-09-24,,"I drink it to improve sleep. The taste is so-so. I brew it in a thermos. A very useful herb, also known as passion fruit. I recommend it. It is effective only with continuous use over a long period of time."
206,30819,2024-08-27,Frontier that you can trust and eat~,"Although it is a bit much, I am grateful to be able to drink organic tea. I drink passion flower for sleep and hormonal cycle. "
207,30819,2024-05-22,Large capacity and great value,It's a natural tranquilizer. The scent is fresh and the cut size makes it easy to put in a pot. Drinking it when you're feeling anxious or uneasy can help you relax.
208,30819,2024-05-16,,"I recommend it, and its taste is somewhat similar to yerba mate, which is a popular drink in Argentina. It is considered a popular drink. I think I will repeat it."
209,30819,2024-05-14,sweet,It is still being tested and I don't feel the taste of it. The size is large and it stays for a very long time
210,30819,2024-05-07,Excellent,The herb needs no introduction. I found every herbal tea I bought containing this herb. I said I would buy it alone and mix with it my herbs that I love in general. I love herbs and I like to try all types. 
211,30819,2024-03-28,,This herb is useful for relaxation and reduces the level of cortisone in the blood. It treats mood swings. It is used in the form of tea in water. The size is very suitable. It is free of caffeine. 
212,30819,2024-03-02,,"Top, good quality ingredients with good taste Use for tea blends. Good size and packaging. One serving per daily frequency increases the benefits. I don't know if there is caffeine "
213,30819,2024-02-22,good herb for sleep and mood,"It’s a very good herb for sleep. It’s clean, dry and fragrant. I drink it at night. It makes me sleep very well. During the day, it lifts my mood and relieves anxiety."
214,30819,2024-02-05,Surprised by the large capacity,Fresh herbs arrive in large bags. The cost performance is quite good. I blend it with chamomile and drink it before bed. It's easy to drink and helps me sleep better. I would like to continue consuming it by mixing it with various herbs.
215,30819,2023-11-07,Recommendation by Reem Al-Anazi,"The quality is good, the ingredients are clean, the taste is somewhat acceptable. Use before bed for deep sleep and without insomnia. The size is large. The box is a tea bag without caffeine"
216,30819,2023-11-05,Perfect for night blending,"I definitely felt a relaxing effect. It didn't have a strong taste, so it was delicious to drink. I made a lot of tea bags with mint, elderberry, stevia, and passion fruit leaf. I am satisfied with both the natural look and size."
217,30819,2024-02-23,,"I had insomnia and wanted to sleep without using medicine as much as possible, so I researched herbs and purchased this. The effect is gradual and makes you feel sleepy? That's what it feels like. Although they are not as clearly effective as prescription drugs, they are safer to take. I think it's like a natural stabilizer. I drink it at night before going to bed if possible. Once I had a few drinks during the day, I felt groggy during the day, so I think it has a sedative effect. I think it's due to my constitution, but once I get used to it, I develop a tolerance to it, so I try to drink it at regular intervals."
218,30819,2024-09-07,Good,"Use as a tea with valerian roots. The taste is not good, but the benefit is good, so I will continue drinking it. The size is large. The serving is a tablespoon with a tablespoon of valerian roots."
219,30819,2023-02-23,,"I drank it as soon as it arrived today! The taste was not peculiar and it was very easy to drink (* ^^ *) It has a large capacity and is the best value for money ☆ I thought about buying a blended product for menstruation and headaches, but it was expensive and I refused. However, I decided to make a favorite blend by making a note of the herbs that I wanted for myself on YouTube. The flavor is not too strong, so you can enjoy various combinations♪ Repeat decision."
220,30819,2023-01-11,,"Its quantity is worth its price for safety 👏🏻 Its taste is not bitter, it means a little strange, but acceptable, it is useful for anxiety, but do not make my mistake and take a large dose. Start with the text of a small spoon with a cup of boiling water and cover it to rest for 5-10 minutes and drink it 🥹 because it gets dizzy again, take it gradually and see that it answers sleep and drowsiness And it really reduces the symptoms of stress, but take it in the right way 💗💗 And do not take it at the beginning of your day because you will be sleepy, and do not take it while driving or when you want to study ⭕️"
221,30819,2023-09-09,"I thought it was a lie, but I started getting sleepy while drinking it.","Put passionflower herb and peppermint tea in a tea pack, pour boiling water and wait for 7 minutes. It has a nice color to it, so drink it little by little even though it's still hot. 20 minutes until it becomes human skin. If you drink a few sips, you will feel sleepy by the time you finish drinking. I thought it was a lie when the review said it made me sleepy, but I tried it a few times and still had the same problem. It has a grassy scent, so I drink it with peppermint that I bought at iherb. >I have already mentioned the scent. What about the ingredients? You won't know unless you do a component analysis at a specialized institution, so please do it at iHerb."

224,30819,2023-10-07,Prominent,"I took it for insomnia. It is excellent for relief, but I drink it. I sit for half an hour and sleep. How to use: Take a small spoonful in a cup of boiling water, leave it for ten minutes and drink it after filtering it. The size is large, the quantity is good, and the taste is unpalatable, but with time you get used to it."
225,30819,2023-08-21,,"The tea smells like grass and tastes like grass, but if you blend it with other herbs such as mint or rosemary, you won't mind.

268,30819,2022-08-19,For a good night's sleep. Very economical.,"I've had trouble falling asleep, had many nightmares, and clenched my teeth while falling asleep, causing my teeth to chip. Until now, I was drinking tea bag type sleep tea from other companies, but I got tired of the taste, so in my case, I drink it every day, so I bought this one because it is economical and has a large capacity. About 60 to 70% of this passiflora is mixed with lavender, chamomile, mint, etc. according to the mood. I take 1 to 1.5 teaspoons in a teacup 30 minutes before going to bed. When you want to make the taste stronger, you can adjust it without hesitation because there are many. I've been drinking it almost every day for more than two months, and it's just as easy to fall asleep as the sleep tea I've been drinking so far, and I'm sleeping better than when I don't drink it. I also grind my teeth less. Passionflower itself has a unique scent. I personally feel that it has a fragrant grassy scent that makes me feel nostalgic. You may love it or hate it. I personally liked the scent and taste. The quantity is quite large. If you don't use it right away, put it in a large aluminum zip with a small desiccant and store it. It is necessary to secure a storage place, but it is very economical and recommended."

So I have a lot of them, but I've always tried various herbal teas as my favorite. The taste is neither good nor bad personally. It has a unique aftertaste, like bean-based or wheat-based tea rather than herbs. Personally, I'm tired of this alone, so if I add it to other blended herbal teas, I can drink it every day. I bought it for the purpose of relaxing, so it's a perfect score in that respect! I drink it every day, so I'm glad that it has a large capacity."
271,30819,2017-05-04,"Passionflower or passionflower - helps to fall asleep, regulates pressure and pulse, soothes","I started taking it as a tincture, then I ordered it in the form of grass. I drink tea an hour before sleep, then cuts down. Problems with sleep (woke up at night and could not fall asleep) were gone. I add chamomile, valerian, mint on mood. I highly recommend those who struggle with insomnia. Now I have a clear sleep regime, in the evening you want, you do not want to go to bed at the same time, I wake up too. Passionflower helped me."
272,30819,2016-11-04,"Anxiety, panic disorder very effective","Passion flower calms the central nervous system of the brain and suppresses wasteful consumption of serotonin, so it is very effective for anxiety, panic disorder, depression and epilepsy. If you drink before going to sleep, you will not get sleeping pills and you will only be able to take a deep sleep naturally and it is handy. Actually, since I started drinking passion flower, my depression has almost disappeared, and my anticipatory anxiety is suppressed by about 60%. I am thankful that it is expensive in Japan."
