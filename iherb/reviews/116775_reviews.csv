0,116775,2024-07-30,A Peaceful Companion,"My high-energy pup, Max, always had trouble settling down. He was anxious during thunderstorms, fireworks, and even car rides. I tried various calming aids, but nothing seemed to work until I found NaturVet Evolutions Advanced Calming Support.

I was impressed by the blend of Ashwagandha, chamomile, ginger, and other natural ingredients. After a few weeks of using the product, I noticed a significant difference in Max's behavior. He's calmer, more relaxed, and less reactive to loud noises.

The soft chews are easy to administer, and the fact that they're vet formulated and NASC certified gives me peace of mind. I'm so grateful for this product and would highly recommend it to any pet owner dealing with an anxious or stressed-out dog."
1,116775,2024-08-22,Helps calm down,"I have been trying this supplement with my dogs recently since there have been loud thunders in my area and I think somehow it does help calm them down. Of course it doesn't work in an instant but I think it helps improve their mood and reaction to the loud thunder. The packaging is convenient since I don't always give it out to my dogs I can just leave it with the cap screwed on. The size of the chew is a little bit big for small dogs though, and I haven't tried giving it to my small dog since he's a picky eater but for the bigger dogs, it works great."
2,116775,2023-12-07,Not bad,"I have an extremely reactive dog and nothing worked with her, this helped a bit with her being alert all the time 
The ingredients seemed good enough to try it
So I think it would work better with other dogs especially for anxiety and barking cause It worked on my other do 
I don't have any concerns but I recommend to check the ingredients to make sure ur dog is not allergic to an of them 
Good quality over all "
3,116775,2024-09-18,great for thunderstorms,My sweet doggy is so afraid of thunderstorms and lightening. I searched so many websites and found nothing. Then a friend told me she used this product and found it on Iherb. My dog seems much more calmer
4,116775,2024-02-09,,During periods of high stress in dogs Give him something to eat and he will seem calmer and more relaxed until he can sleep normally. It is considered a good helper.
5,116775,2024-07-01,My dog hates it,"When i bought it i read every ingredient and figured this would be pretty good for my anxious and stressed dog when he goes through chemo but even though he literally eats everything except for cucumbers he refuses to eat it. I smelt it, and I admit that it does't smell good but refusing to even try it is insane. Think the quality is okay but I'll never know if it works. "
6,116775,2023-06-15,Sleep support for my dementia dog,"My senior corgi who is suffering from dementia started to have problem sleeping through the night since beginning of this year.  On the advice of his physiotherapist, I found this and started him on it 2 months ago.  Now he is able to sleep through the night and waking up only 1-2 times in the wee hours to pee. I usually give this to him 30 mins before his bedtime....I have just ordered my third bottle!~"
7,116775,2024-04-07,not so sure,"I tried so many time to give those to my dog 
Sometimes they work and sometimes not 
So tbh not so sure what to

10,116775,2024-04-02,love this!,"my pup loves it, and it has a subtle ACV smell and is in a cute star-shaped treat. "
11,116775,2024-02-25,,"Nice product. My two dogs love it. I haven’t noticed any calming effects yet, but it’s a nice treat for a dog."
12,116775,2024-01-27,It's a great supplement for your furkid,My 12 year old ShihTzu is less stressed or panicky these days. This tasty chewable supplement works for my dog. 
13,116775,2023-09-27,Works well for 3 hours,"it works well for my 27lb dog. I watch her over camera and she is more relaxed when taking the supplement. It extends her ""calm time"" but only for 3 hours"
14,116775,2023-08-02,,"Bought it for my doggo who is too sensitive. And feels sad when I am not around . 
Haven’t tried yet. 
Hopefully it will help my baby "
15,116775,2023-05-27,,"I was genuinely surprised that this worked for my dog and does help him to calm down or sooth his anxiety in general. Since he is a fussy eater, I did worry he won't like the taste or refuse to eat it, however he didn't hesitate at all.  Recently there have been some bad weather, heavy rain storm and thunder. During this period I have tried doubling the dosage, but it didn't do much for him. But to be fair, I have some prescribed medication from my vet for calming and even those didn't work. My dog could still chew through a door and a cage during bad weather. I would definitely prefer feeding my dog something natural rather than having him on medication in the long run. "
16,116775,2023-05-31,,The product is affordable and well packed. I will definitely purchase again!
17,116775,2023-07-12,,"before my dog has been agressive recently but after few weeks taking this supplement, she seems to be more calm and relax."
18,116775,2023-06-10,,"Got it for my dog with anxiety, it seems to be working for her."
19,116775,2024-09-26,Thank you.,"I took it for my dog. She was very restless. I give her 1 piece once a day. The restlessness has passed, she is calm and sleeps well. Excellent, natural supplement. I recommend. I will order more. "
20,116775,2024-04-22,,"This is the third time I have purchased it. The puppy likes it very much! I feed the puppy once in the morning every day. If the puppy is really anxious that day, I will feed an extra pill in the afternoon! After eating, the puppy is easier to fall asleep. If he has nothing to say, he will get up to see what happened! There is some help, but it is not the medicine prescribed by the doctor!"
21,116775,2024-08-21,,"We took it for a test for the dog. To see the effect, I think you need to take a course of at least a month. It seems not bad. We continue to drink and observe "
22,116775,2024-06-18,,"Good composition. They turned out to be too big for a Yorkie, but the vitamins break easily, but do not crumble. The dog eats them with pleasure. And it seems to me that he became a little calmer. We will continue to accept"
23,116775,2024-01-12,very effective,"Because I bought two products at the same time, both have sleep-aiding ingredients. This one has melanin-reducing properties, which is relatively powerful. I will only give if it refuses to sleep at all."
24,116775,2023-12-09,Good,"Good quantity for the price, convenient packaging. Bought after many recommendations. The dog doesn't like the taste at all so I mix it with her food and she doesn't notice. Waiting to see if it helps her"
25,116775,2023-12-23,very good,"If the dog likes the taste, give him two pills at a time."
26,116775,2024-02-22,Doesn't seem to smell particularly appetizing,"Taste, not for picky eaters, the other dogs don't want to eat it either. Can't notice any major changes in quality or ingredients. ."
27,116775,2024-09-21,Well enough,I bought this to soothe my dog. Sometimes I give it a pill when it can't sleep at night.
28,116775,2023-07-24,Great,"A good product for dogs, the capsules are not large, which makes them easier to consume. Without smell. The result is visible in a week"
29,116775,2023-06-26,,"The dog ate literally two pieces and refuses to eat it ... York, 4 years old, barks a lot, I thought this would calm him down a little, but no."
30,116775,2023-05-31,Excellent!,"I regularly buy this food supplement for my pet. The coat began to shine, the dog became calmer."
31,116775,2023-09-27,dogs like to eat,"The dog likes to eat it. If I get help, I will buy it again."
