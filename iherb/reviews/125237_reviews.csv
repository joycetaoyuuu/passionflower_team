I heard from an acquaintance that so I bought some, and I was surprised! I was skeptical about whether it really works, but after about 30 minutes to an hour, I started to feel like, ""Huh?"" It became hard to open my eyes, and after about an hour and a half, I couldn't open my eyes anymore. However, even though I can't open my eyes, my brain is awake and I'm in a dream-like state. (It's an interesting feeling, like my soul is gone.) When I'm in a relaxed state, I can fall asleep easily. Either way, I think it's very good for my body because it helps me wake up in the morning. The supplement has a cut so that it's easy to cut into half tablets, and when I think I can do it with half a tablet, I take it in half a tablet. Half a tablet is also effective. The supplement contains not only melatonin but also herbs, so it has a strong smell. I'm sorry for the bad expression, but I'm sorry when I opened it for the first time. I said it smelled bad lol. I think it also works well without the herbs, so if you are concerned about the smell, try the herb-free version. Thank you for listening to my story. Excuse me."
