2,143821,2024-09-03,Perfectly ,"We have a problem with falling asleep, so we bought these patches. Small squares with a moon, thin, perforated, they will not disturb the child, without a pronounced aroma. We have a whole ritual in the evening with a sticker and it also helps)) I see a positive trend, but so far we have not completely solved the problem, we continue to use it together with other means.

3,143821,2024-10-08,Didn't expect it ,"When this product appeared on iHerb, I immediately decided to try it. Especially since I heard good reviews about them. I have a small child who has problems with sleep, and I myself sleep poorly, my sleep is restless and superficial, it is often difficult to fall asleep after waking up. I decided to try it on myself and my child at the same time. The composition of the patches is excellent! I was pleasantly surprised ‚ù§Ô∏è At first it seemed to me that they did not work, I was skeptical. But there is an effect. And this is delight. I will try further, I hope to continue my laudatory review üôè
