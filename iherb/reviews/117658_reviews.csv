1,117658,2024-07-09,For Relaxation,I bought it because of the reviews.  I take it in a little water and I do not have problem with the taste.  I don't take it every day. I have other Swanson supplements and am happy with the quality of this product too.  I like that it is alcohol free too.

3,117658,2024-04-03,,"First time trying Passion Flower.  I read it was good for sleep and it did help me get restful sleep, at times immediate, other times it took a while to fall asleep.  I didn't take it as recommended, I would take the dose in the evening when I was ready for bed."
4,117658,2024-01-30,Passionflower Extract,"I like this passionflower extract because it improves nervous energy and reduces stress. I take it in a little bit of water. The taste is vaguely herbal but not unpleasant. It is extracted in glycerin, which is more pleasant than if it were in alcohol. I benefit the most from it when i have it before bed. Swanson's products are good quality, I am totally satisfied."
5,117658,2023-12-07,Чудово!,"Passion flower is an age-old herb that's recently been ""rediscovered"" as an aid for reducing nervous energy.

6,117658,2024-08-23,Good product. ,"I tried buying this for a body spray I was making that called for passionflower extract. This was the only thing even close that I could find. Well it definitely didn’t work for that. lol. My bad. I do put half a dropper in my drink almost everyday. Seems like it is calming. And mixed in a drink, you don’t even really taste it so that’s good. "
7,117658,2024-06-25,Прекрасно!,I use it as a stress relief. I liked the taste of the extract. The quality is good. The size of the bottle is enough for more than one month.
8,117658,2024-05-02,Enjoy! ,I do enjoy this. It has a sort of prunelike taste but caused a fairly relaxed feeling. No weird aftertaste or stomach problems. I feel it benefits my ability to relax. The dosage is one pinch. A good size!

13,117658,2023-08-29,Good Quality Passion Flower Tincture ,"I tried this product for the first time a couple of days ago. I prefer natural products with minimal ingredients and this one meets that requirement. Passion Flower is very beneficial for stress, anxiety, and insomnia and this one worked well for me so I believe it is a good quality product. I also like that it’s made with glycerin which makes it easier to take, and not alcohol. It also has a long life span and doesn’t expire until December of 2025. It was packaged well, shipped quickly, and received safely. "
14,117658,2023-08-03,Great passionflower extract!,"Passionflower is a soothing herb that helps calm one for a good night's sleep. This extract works very well. One dropper full is typically all you  need to sleep through the night. But if you wake up during the night, you can always take a little more. Not too much, because  then it might  make you drowsy in the morning. 
Flavor is fairly pleasant--a little sweet."
