0,66284,2024-05-22,Wow. Major calmer for stressful events,When we gave this to our dogs—two salukis with strong anxiety—they pretty much fell asleep immediately. This is the kind of stuff you want for when they are going to do something stressful - like go to the vet or go in a car.  They were back up to being hyper and agitated as usual later in the day so I do not know that this works well as a long-term medicine but it works well for event-related stress. They happily ate the tablet with no fuss. 
1,66284,2024-03-27,Good ,"The size and the package are perfect, its very good for the immunity and the quality and the ingredient are very good, they didn’t faced any side effect nor stomach issues and its taste normal i think , i don’t use everyday although they’re getting the benefit, my concern is when they get older with their age for that i’m always checking their diet and to see the improvement day by day"
2,66284,2024-02-13,Chewable Tablets,"When I opened the box, I thought my dog wouldn't agree to take these tablets as they look more like the usual tablets than dog treats or chewable tablets, and my dog usually hates tablets. But she does seem to like them and chews them voluntarily, so it's all good."
3,66284,2024-03-19,It works,"This product really works well. It changed our cat's behavior so much, we limited using it. So, if you are trying to tame a stray cat- this can be your friend to get a night's sleep. "
4,66284,2024-05-02,Positive product review,"These tablets helped calm my dog even when taking less than recommended amount. There were no side affects that we spoted, and the dog was much more relaxed than usually."
5,66284,2024-01-30,It works!,This does not take effect immediately. My dog took it for three days to see the some improvement. He does get more relaxed. What’s important is that this is drug free. 
6,66284,2023-12-03,,Excellent! great quality product. it really works as intended. Will definitely get more soon! Thank you so much for this. it was made of high qualiy ingredients. Plus the packaging and sizes were perfect. over all good quality. i love the smell and the looks of it. im looking forward to purchasing another one!
7,66284,2024-01-08,big,"couldn't get my cats to chew this, ended up crushing these and hiding in their food. but even then they hated the taste so much they managed to spit it out."
8,66284,2024-10-07,didn't like it,"my cats didn't even touch it. it's pretty smelly, my cats enjoy smelling it but run away when I tried giving it to them. no idea if it works, so pretty much a waste of money for me."
9,66284,2023-06-14,,great quality product. it really works as intended. Will definitely get more soon! Thank you so much for this. it was made of high qualiy ingredients. Plus the packaging and sizes were perfect. over all good quality. i love the smell and the looks of it. im looking forward to purchasing another one!
10,66284,2023-05-10,Good for long term use,"I use these for 3 of my cats who don't get along. I give half a pill daily. They are easy to split, and the rounded edge goes down easily.. There are no negative side effects, and the cats don't mind the taste. The cats seem to be less agitated since I started using the pills 2 months ago.  I stopped giving it to one for the last week or so, and she has got quite grumpy with the other cats in the last few days. They don't chew them.  "
11,66284,2024-08-22,,"My cat really liked it, helped her be more calm during her heat"
12,66284,2024-05-26,מצוין!,"Great amazing calming nice relaxing

14,66284,2024-04-18,Good ,Got this for my two puppies to relieve their stress. 
15,66284,2024-02-17,,"Love it , doesn’t work immediately , need more  time , I mixed it with the food "
16,66284,2023-12-03,My dog is relaxed ,In minutes my dog calms down and minding his own things instead of jumping around with anxiety
17,66284,2023-06-23,,"This has quality ingredients & seemed to taste very good to my fur baby. I used them with her to help her be more calm, especially when I had to be away from her."
18,66284,2022-11-13,,"This us a great product and a wonderful company. I was looking for these exact ingredients. My one dog is a rescue, and this is why I even got this product."
19,66284,2023-09-10,,Took about a week for my little Shi Tzu to start showing some change for the better in his anxious behavior..  but he's definitely becoming his old self again. Good safe ingredients here. Will order again!
20,66284,2023-08-31,,"a must buy for dogs and cats , especially baby pets , it helps with barking and make them calmer , also during coupling days , very useful while traveling with plane or a car 
the company did a great call on this one breaking the old travel suffering "
21,66284,2024-05-22,Can't tell if they work,I can barely get her to eat them. I don't think she likes the taste.
22,66284,2024-03-07,Didn’t work for my dog,"I was really hoping this would work for when we have our tropical thunderstorms, but I’m sorry to report it didn’t"
23,66284,2023-11-07,Didn't help my pet,The ingredients looks good but didn't work on my dog.
24,66284,2023-10-04,great,"I use this for my dog who lately panting while driving on the highway, I do noticed she is a bit better "
25,66284,2023-10-01,Didn't relax my dog.,I have used 5 days in a row.  There was no improvement in relaxing my dog.  She has anxiety from storms.  I used daily for 5 days.  I didn't see any improvement at all.  My dog was still scared during a storm. This didn't help calm my dog.  
26,66284,2023-03-09,,"Good quality and ingredients, the size also good. But my dog didn’t like the taste. She eats it with her food. I usually give her when there is thunderstorms."
27,66284,2016-08-01,Now Foods Pet Relaxant,"I tried this out of the slight hope that it will help my elderly golden retriever to calm down during storms. It takes about 30mins for the tablets to work its magic. My golden stays calm at some of severe thunderstorms without getting into such a huge panic. 
This will be one product that I will purchase more again. "
28,66284,2023-09-27,Great relaxant,Works well like other melatonin brands out there. Helps with calming my dog all night long
29,66284,2023-09-10,,"Great relaxant for cats/dogs, really help to calm the stress, before or during the stress event."
30,66284,2023-09-08,Seems to work,"Calming just enough, worth a try.  Give it a try."
31,66284,2022-12-16,,Comes in amazing tablet form that my dogs love! Great buy too!
32,66284,2024-09-03,Hard to break ,I was disappointed with the product the cats wont eat the pill and its was impossible to break to powder so i threw away 
33,66284,2024-06-13,not useful,my cats did not like the taste. could not use it to determine if its effective
34,66284,2022-01-17,,"My dog does seems calmer after taking the supplement. Whenever I bring him out for his daily stroll, it is easier to call him run back to me now as compared to previously where he was constantly distracted by his surroundings and it was difficult to walk him then. "
35,66284,2021-11-22,,"My cat takes half a pill twice to three times a week. I add this to his biscuits. The only downside is needing to break the pill manually, and there's no scoring line to facilitate this."
36,66284,2023-05-16,,what are good quality who is prodact for use every day I like it very much. Recommend it to all.
37,66284,2023-05-24,,Amazing product. Gets the job done perfectly and excellent packaging. However my dog is not fan of the taste
38,66284,2023-05-14,It’s rather an irritant,"I used this for two cats. I gave half a tablet each.
To my surprise both cats became so restless and kept on meowing constantly. 
Calm and relaxed was not the outcome as you claim.
That’s bad.. "
39,66284,2022-07-20,,"This tablets have potential but i can’t say they are chewable tablets because they are quite big and hard and the smell is not good at all (I believe because of the valerian). My cat could not eat it as “food”. I had to give it as a pill cause she would not eat it. This product has good potential because it has good ingredients, good size and acceptable price but the taste definitely need improvement."
40,66284,2020-05-14,Natural Remedy working good for the anxiety,"My German boxers are around 35kg each and to give them 3 tablets I am crushing them in the powder and add on the food. They do not seem to bother much even though they can be picky at times if any medicine is added to the food. So I take that as a good sign that the product is really natural.

You need to allow couple of days for the effect to slightly build up so I'd say this is not a product for instant calming result - I hope that serves to those who are about to travel etc to start giving the pills couple of days before.

Also, do not expect any sedation signs - this is a natural remedy not chemical sedative so it takes away the anxiety but cannot calm down your pet if the stressy situation is average and high. I used them after moving to a new house and that helped my dogs to remain curious but not stressed with all the new noises. Hope that helps :)"
41,66284,2019-12-22,Dog is calm (probably) thanks to these tablets,"I have a dog with special needs. Due to us moving to a new house, I wanted to make sure his stress levels are as low as can be, under yhr circumstances. Along with other methods (calming music etc.), I made sure to give him the recommended dosage of this product. As the results are satisfactory, I am very happy :)"
42,66284,2019-07-17,"NOW Foords  Pet Relaxant For Dogs/Cats, 90 Chewable Tablets","These tabs are great for keeping your anxious pets chill in a hurry  - as we approached fireworks season I  began giving my 2 noise-sensitive felines the recommended amount, and they had good responses almost overnight. Made then mellow but not groggy, they think it's yummy, and are not as fearful when the mini-explosions occur, lol. I've had consistently good experiences with NOW Foods products for many, many years-Thumbs up to another great product, and awesome fast delivery by iHerb as always!"
43,66284,2018-09-28,Working great!,"My dear 12 year old beagle is now blind and goes through a lot of anxiety now, she was becoming very anxious in the house especially  when left alone. This product has been working great! If I have to leave her for several hours I give her one in the morning,  she is relaxed and calm when I return, it has even improved the accidents in the house considerably as i really see now they were a result mostly of the anxiety. I give her a second one in the evening and she sleeps all night. They do have that very strong valerian odor but she has no problem eating it, gobbles it up eagerly like a treat. Great price too!"
44,66284,2018-06-23,Effective product for our pack,"Effective for calming my dogs when I work until 11pm.  After a walk they get a partial portion  of the tablet in their food, a small rawhide stick to chew, and then we all settle down to sleep.  No problem with the taste of the tablet or being able to break it."
45,66284,2018-06-06,How to help a very scared dog!,"Excellent product! My dog deadly scared of thunderstorms and rain, now is shy but confident and has stopped shaking and salivating for the fear. I can even bring her for a short walk during the bad weather. I give her the product only when she really needs and it takes about 20 minutes to have an effect,"
46,66284,2018-02-10,No more serenades!,"One of my cats (Tommy-boy) is very vocal and practicing his singing skills at night by the window (the cats are indoor). So it was very challenging for me to sleep at night without opening my eyes on each meowwww ! Just 1/2 tablets at evening makes him calm and quiet. Another cat just going crazy about this Pet Relaxant but she is not getting it without need. And need will appear when we will move again to another house...
Please give me your 'yes' if my sharing helped you with your decision. "
47,66284,2020-11-02,The Pill Is Big And Need To Be Cutted,Be aware of the recommended dose. If you need to give it to your cat then it probably needs to be cutter. My cats did not like it and did not chew it. You can cut the pill and add it to the cats dry food. I think there are better products that cats eat them without issues 
48,66284,2020-02-12,"My cat loves the taste and does calm down, but it takes a double dose","I first tried with the suggested 0,5 tablet for my (5,5 kg) cat, but didn't see any results. Then I doubled it and started seeing him calming down  a bit. But it does take some hours to kick in. Opposite to the other reviews my cat loves the smell and the taste :D"
49,66284,2018-02-17,Big tablets are a pain for small pets,"These tablets are huge, so for my kitties i have to cut them in half, which causes crumbles and broken pills. It isn't really a problem because I put them in the Feline Greenies Pill Pockets. The taste of these tabs doesn't bother the kitties at all, so they eat every bit. I only wish they were smaller."
50,66284,2023-09-28,Cats don't eat it,My cats don't eat it and it's kinda hard to break apart... I should hand it to some dog owner. 
51,66284,2023-08-24,,I'm trying different suppliments for calming for my cats ongoing anxiety.  It's an ongoing trial and error
52,66284,2023-06-29,,Not sure if it works. My furries not very keen in it
53,66284,2023-05-17,,"Wonderful 
Good size and good quality 
Highly recommended 
Nice packing "
54,66284,2023-03-23,אישור,"Bought it for my cats, but they didnt like the taste and didnt want to eat the wet food with it "
55,66284,2022-02-08,,I don’t know why but my cats couldn’t take it 😓
56,66284,2022-08-01,,"my cat would't take it as a treat, realy didn't like it. if i wanted to give her the tablet had to crash it into yogurt. didn't see much of improvement but probably beacuse she didn't took it for a while"
57,66284,2019-02-14,Love this Product,Really calms my dog  - especially at night - just one tablet and she settles down less than 1/2 hr and sleep throughout the night.  Does not bother by the smell and  size.  She just enjoys it.
58,66284,2017-05-04,Good product.,"My dog is a sweety but he is very stressful, especially in car rides. I have been giving him these tablets and I feel that his stress level has gone down. :D"
59,66284,2022-10-19,,Very fast & product is affordable and items are shipped immediately.
60,66284,2021-11-29,,seems to helps a little. my dog is old already though.
61,66284,2021-11-16,,It is my 1st time using it. And it seems it works 🥰
62,66284,2021-04-21,,My cats love this treat and it helps them calm down and sleep better at night when they start running and fighting in the middle of the night.
63,66284,2018-02-15,Calms Dog’s Anxiety,"Our Maltese x Cavalier gets very nervous in storms or fireworks - we have to hide it for him to eat it, but it WORKS! Takes about 20-30 minutes, but calms his nerves and helps him mellow back out. Love these!"
64,66284,2022-04-10,,"My dog eats it without any problem, but we don't see any influence on him yet."
65,66284,2023-04-20,,Unfortunately they didn't help my super anxious pup with his fear of storms
66,66284,2022-12-03,,"It doesnt do anything for our furkid, he continues to wheeze whenever he gets excited. "
67,66284,2022-10-20,,and please with the ingredients and quality of this product it's great to use this for improvement with my felines Healthcare
68,66284,2018-08-28,Great product,Does what claims to has helped my boy with walking
69,66284,2018-07-12,pet relaxants,"these tablets are massive, my cat will not eat these, not sure how palatable they are or if they even work,
they are literally the size of a 50c piece, seems like a mission to try to break up and mix into food so i have not even bothered to do so
animals in general do not like tablets, if this was available in a powder form it would be easier to administrate.
will not purchase again."
70,66284,2018-01-04,Amazing!,"Working pretty well, my dog liked the flavor and it makes him relaxed after 30 minutes. I will purchase it again"
71,66284,2022-03-02,,"Good product quality , size and price"
72,66284,2019-08-10,not sure yet,"we are using it for a while now, I don't see much different yet, but it may take a bit longer…. I've ordered it because our dog barks a lot during the day and I hope that would help"
73,66284,2018-01-11,No change no gain ,i have seen no change in my cat. She recently had two operations one (dental) and the other (tick rescue) and both times she was given anaesthetics so she unfortunately attained neurosis and believes that her tail needs to be attacked. I failed to mention that she is a himalayan and they shaved her completely so she sees this hairless tail and I presume she thinks it belongs to a rat or whatever and wants to attack it. I thought with the help of rescue remedy it would help her with her stress levels but I unfortunately have seen nothing 
74,66284,2021-10-16,,Too bad my dog doesn’t like this kind of tablets. Would have preferred a chewable. 
75,66284,2021-09-01,,"My dog is more relaxed, less reactive than before "
76,66284,2019-08-18,"Unpleasant smell, so bad that cats won’t touch it","Pungent smell, unpleasant even to the human nose. My cats smelled it and refused to touched it, even when crushed into powder and mixed with their favourite wet food."
77,66284,2018-03-01,Huge,No way a cat would eat something this size so tried to melt it in cat milk... even that didn’t work. Maybe good for dogs but really do not see it as convenient for cats...
78,66284,2017-12-09,Great for my cat,This product really helps to calm my cat down
79,66284,2021-11-08,,"expensive but works
"
80,66284,2021-01-22,,My cat goes crazy when he smells this & wants to eat it so bad.
81,66284,2017-07-28,Dog refuses to eat them!,Not sure if these are effective as my dog will not eat them.
82,66284,2021-09-01,Good,Didn’t use it yet
83,66284,2021-04-16,,реально хорошо успокаивает собачку.

88,66284,2020-09-29,It didn't work to calm them down. ,I have tried on my 11 dogs and it didnt work on any of them. 
89,66284,2017-12-27,no effect,"my dog gets stressed in car, didnt see any effect "
90,66284,2021-08-25,,"Haven’t tried it yet, i need feedback please "
91,66284,2018-12-15,Not working.,Didn't work for my dog at all.
92,66284,2021-04-08,,no special
93,66284,2019-08-19,flavor,"my dog doesn't like its flavor......reject to eat haha
It has odd odor....."
94,66284,2021-05-06,,Didn't help my dog
95,66284,2021-04-15,,no effect on my dog
96,66284,2020-10-25,Wasn't Effective ,Didn't really did anything.No effect at all
97,66284,2020-09-22,,It doesn't work on my dog.
98,66284,2020-06-12,My both cats refuse to eat it,My cats refuse to eat it
99,66284,2021-01-25,不滿意,no use
100,66284,2024-02-01,Give it to cats,"I don’t know if it really works, but I can’t resist the taste. I give half a pill in the morning and evening and eat it directly as a snack. Cats tend to be nervous. I hope it will improve after eating more for a while. I feel that the cat’s fur is smoother. I don’t know if I have eaten it. This relationship!"
101,66284,2024-09-26,Finally found a way to feed cats easily!,"I don't know the quality, the ingredients should be fine, but the taste is terrible, the cat won't eat a bite because of the stinky smell, the portion is large and the packaging is good. It should be good for cats, but he won't eat it. Even if it is put in his favorite food, he won't eat it, so I don't know how to see improvement. My cat has no skin problems. Eat this. Just to prevent him from scratching himself. My cat has obsessive-compulsive disorder. I hope the manufacturer can make it taste good for cats. This money is wasted. Please see the photo, I crushed the tablets and mixed them into the cat's favorite cat strips, but my cat wouldn't eat them. The first two days, my cat wouldn't eat them, I was at a loss, then I broke the tablets into very small pieces and sandwiched them in freeze-dried food, and my baby happily ate them. Today is the second day, and she seems to be really quiet. If the effect continues. I will give 5 stars. My baby scratches herself like this, my heart is broken. Today is October 19, 2024. My cat kicked off the Elizabethan collar on the 15th and I never wore it again. He also did not over-interpret the compulsive behavior of hair. Share the method of taking this medicine: you can break this medicine into very small pieces, put each piece into a square freeze-dried, or put it in a sticky cat strip (there are skills when using this method. Don't put them all in the cat strip at once. First, put two small pieces into the cat strip, push the cat strip up from the bottom so that the cat strip can wrap the medicine, and then feed it to the cat. As long as he opens his mouth, keep pushing the cat strip into his mouth, so as to prevent him from spitting out the medicine). After taking this medicine, the cat feels quieter. I wrote this review three times, and I didn't delete the previous one each time, but just added the new content for your reference."
102,66284,2023-11-27,Good product,"Excellent product for our pets to feel calmer in the face of a stressful situation. I prefer a product that is chewier so that they feel more comfortable eating it, like a snack, for this reason I don't give them 5 stars. But it is a good product and helps with situations that keep them anxious."
103,66284,2024-04-21,Great product ,"We gave it to the dogs when we moved, don't know about the taste but in a snack, the dogs ate and it seems to have helped."
104,66284,2023-10-26,Excellent!,"Convenient use, according to the size and weight of everything. Very calming to the dog. Recommended for dogs with abandonment anxiety works wonders! Highly recommend but only if necessary! Do not give to the dog for no reason because the pill can really put the dog to sleep"
105,66284,2024-10-10,How to help with separation anxiety ,"My whippet does not tolerate loneliness, car rides, visits to the vet, as a natural means for relaxation, I did not see any special effects, but there will be no harm from natural supplements"
106,66284,2024-08-30,I didn't see any change,"I didn't see any change in the dog and he didn't want to go near it either, so I gave him an angel"
107,66284,2024-06-02,Calms dogs ,Convenient packaging. Taste - which the dog likes. Appropriate size. There is an improvement and relief in the level of tensions. Additional benefits: a large amount and early prevention of stress for the dog from noises and thunder. Use only when pressure is expected.
108,66284,2024-02-27,,"Good quality, good ingredients, the taste, the dogs eat without a problem, calms down within half an hour to about an hour, suitable before the vet, thunder, lightning, etc. Cute packaging
"
109,66284,2023-08-26,A most surprising product!,Excellent quality. I have a Malinois dog. The advantage is that it helps a lot to calm the dog (hyperactive) in a natural way without fear of using the pill. It has a strange and strong smell. You have to convince the dog to swallow and it is a relatively large size for the dog. There is an improvement in behavior
110,66284,2023-06-06,Good,"The composition is good - I was looking for a more budget-friendly alternative to one sedative for cats and dogs with tryptophan and plant extracts (in convenient twist-capsules, with tasty contents). And this Now Pets product contains flavors and flavorings, but the cat refused to eat them. She did not dare to put part of the pill on the root of the animal's tongue - it seems that she can choke - she is very fragile. As an option, grind it into a powder and add it to wet food, but when the cat has a reduced appetite, it is unlikely that food with an additive will arouse interest. Therefore, my impression is that the manufacturer's idea is excellent, the form needs to be worked on."
111,66284,2023-02-25,Fine,"My dog is very stressed when traveling and usually also vomits. About two hours before the trip I gave him the pill and he ate it as is, and he seems to be a little calmer and he didn't vomit. I hope he will continue using the pill like this."
112,66284,2024-10-11,,Great product works good quality very easy to use great size
113,66284,2024-10-08,For pets,"I gave this to my aggressive dog. He liked it, but unfortunately it is not available for purchase at the moment."
114,66284,2024-08-01,,"It works well, but it doesn't seem to have any effect."
115,66284,2023-12-17,,Easy-to-administer palatable product for dogs reduced joint pain in my 15-year-old dog
116,66284,2022-11-05,,"My dog didn't really like the taste, but it worked to calm down. The tablet is quite big, for a small dog it is better to cut it into small pieces"
117,66284,2024-07-30,Should have known each other earlier,"The disadvantage of this chewable tablet is that it is larger, but it does improve the dog’s mood a bit."
118,66284,2023-04-11,,"Well we have an anxious dog and he wasn't that keen to swallow it at first. But it did help after a while. Good quality, relatively fine ball. He slept a little after we let him."
119,66284,2021-11-12,,"The pill is very big, it must be mashed before putting it in food, the smell is a little unpleasant, but I have not tried it yet because I plan to try it when she moves with me to the new house and to be a soothing agent for her because she is new and she is afraid"
120,66284,2023-07-09,,"Good product but our cats are bad with powders, we were able to mix it together with the dry food and some agreed to eat that way"
121,66284,2024-01-23,,"Cats are willing to eat, useful, and relaxed."
122,66284,2022-12-29,Use in the last week,"Easy to use packaging, the dog takes the ball happily. After a week you still don't feel any change, let's hope that later on."
123,66284,2022-10-05,Good to have at home especially in our country.,"The materials from which the supplement is made are excellent. I have faith in this company. My dog is emotional by nature and I bought the supplement to make him less stressed. But he - who usually likes different supplements and snacks too - did not want to eat this supplement. I cut in half and wrap in a piece of bread or pasta. Last Purim, in the playground in front of our house, children threw firecrackers. The dog got under a lot of stress and this drug, although not his favorite, helped really quickly. Works pretty fast but no duration. Good to have such a product at home. I haven't tried giving it to a cat yet."
124,66284,2022-08-07,,"second time I buy for my dog, he is already old and sometimes he gets nervous about being alone. it worked great for him! he eats the pill very well"
125,66284,2022-01-21,Great for calming the dog!,"I have bought this product several times for my dog. The best out of everything I've tried. It is especially good to give before the road or on the eve of departure, so that the dog does not get nervous. She sleeps beautifully and very calmly after it!"
126,66284,2023-09-23,,Quality goods. Suitable for any age. Convenient use according to instructions.

135,66284,2022-01-11,,"I began to give medications to the cat as prescribed by the veterinarian, the animal is clearly better, I'm not sure that only from them, so I give it in combination with medications, but definitely better."
136,66284,2023-08-09,,"To mix food, the effect is not easy to see, hope to improve"
137,66284,2017-02-02,Tablets work,"Very helpful when moving. Our cats calmed down after taking half the pill. One cat chewed with pleasure, the second had to be thrown forcibly. Animals remained adequate, slept well in a new place. One of the cats was a little messed up, but it's good for him, he usually has stool delays."
138,66284,2023-07-28,,Does not work. My dog didn't like the taste. Waste of money if you liked my review please like me 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
139,66284,2022-10-18,,The taste is not appealing and the dog does not like it very much. But it seems to work a little bit after eating it. Give it when you need it.
140,66284,2023-05-29,,"Dogs love to eat it, but it doesn't seem to have a soothing effect"
141,66284,2022-03-22,,"The puppy will tremble when it rains and thunderstorms, and it will calm down a lot after eating this for half an hour"

149,66284,2022-07-25,Nice,"The dog seems to be relaxed, but it doesn't like to eat, so it needs to be mixed with the food."
150,66284,2023-05-14,,"It's useless, it's already eaten into a bottle, it can't help the dog relax at all, so don't buy it!"
151,66284,2021-12-11,Ok,I didn't eat it because I had to eat it
152,66284,2021-01-16,,My cat wants to grab it as soon as it smells it feels delicious

156,66284,2019-08-14,NOT COMPLIANCE WITH THE DECLARED ACTION!,"The tablet size is very large for cats with a diameter of 1.2 cm and a + convex shape ... even by dividing the table. 1/2 animal has difficulty swallowing. THERE IS NO SLEEPING ACTION ... The remedy gives easy relaxation in a stressful situation, as indicated by its composition. It is necessary to grind it into powder and put it into a “dummy” capsule ... None of the cats had the desire to eat - even a street cat treated it. .. - refused. Conclusion - suitable only for dogs (due to size). The manufacturer is misleading by positioning these tabs. as a LIABILITY ... DO NOT RECOMMEND to purchase to improve the intestinal motility of the animal. Money thrown away!"
157,66284,2019-12-18,Approved,Very good Approved
158,66284,2019-11-20,Very bad,"First, the smell is unbearable. Second, the grain is too big for cats."

160,66284,2019-01-09,Stinky,Very stinky dog can’t smell it once at the table.
