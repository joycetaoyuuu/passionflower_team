0,15871,2024-08-15,Quality product,"I tried the Herbs Etc Deep Sleep tincture for a few weeks to help with my sleep. The taste is herbal and strong, which might not be for everyone, but it wasn’t too unpleasant for me. I noticed that it helped me feel more relaxed some nights, it didn’t make me feel groggy in the morning, which I appreciated. Overall, it seemed to have a mild effect on improving sleep, but the effect  may not be strong enough for chronic insomnia."
1,15871,2024-08-14,my favorite,"I like the bitter sweet taste and ofcourse,  love it for their effectiveness. I can feel how i sleepy I get and just wanna lay in my bed, no fog, nothing like this. I like it's alcohol free and with natural ingredients. 
it's worth it. I bought like 3 times already "
2,15871,2024-08-12,,"I've been using this stress relief remedy for a few weeks now, and it's been a game changer. The calming effects are noticeable almost immediately, helping me unwind and stay centered even during the most hectic days. I love that it's all-natural and gentle, with no harsh side effects. It's become a daily staple in my routine, making a real difference in my overall well-being. "
3,15871,2024-05-23,Herbs Etc. Deep Sleep,I ordered Deep Sleep in the hopes that it would help me to sleep through to night. I feel the quality and ingredients are good and the taste is okay. But I haven't really taken it as I should so I really haven't gotten the benefit from it. I will continue to take it.
4,15871,2024-02-09,No groggy after effects.,"Produces a restorative night's sleep without waking up with that lethargic delayed feeling. Never been a big fan of alcohol based tinctures, at all. However, decided to give this version a try and boy oh boy
the difference in the taste is... so oooo...much better. Seems to sort of taste a little bit like raisins."
5,15871,2024-06-15,Works when you really can't sleep ,"I often have trouble sleeping, so have a variety of products to manage the problem. Most of the time melatonin is enough, but during times when I consistently can't sleep Deep Sleep always helps. It helps me fall asleep, andi stay asleep. 
The only problem is that it works so well that I'm often groggy the next morning. And I don't always take the full dose. But it's one of the few things that works when nothing else does."
6,15871,2024-02-06,Helps with sleep ,I bought this for my mum who is in her late 60s and she has found that it aids with the rest in the evening. Bonus that it is alcohol free. 
7,15871,2024-02-01,Good,"These (and similar) drops help me to sleep a little deeper and to be able to fall back asleep if I wake up during the night. They, however, do not help me to fall asleep faster initially."
8,15871,2023-11-08,this helps!,I have only used it for three nights but it already gives me a more straight night sleep. I recommend for people with a bit of anxiety and crazy schedules. It is really helping bme
9,15871,2023-10-24,Great sleep supplement,"High quality ingredients, potent formula, works so much better than Nightol and the 40 doses in such a small bottle makes them easy for storing and portable for overnight trups.

I don't really like the taste much but it's a small price to pay for the benefits. "
10,15871,2024-05-09,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately I didn't get the results I was looking for, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you. There could be benefits for others. The ingredients are good, the quality is good and you may have to adjust the dosage. The taste is very palatable. The size is questionable."
11,15871,2023-11-15,Didn't meet my expectations. ,After reading all the positive  reviews I was very excited to try this sleeping aid. I was very disappointed with the result. It didn't do much for me. To justify this price it had to have been exceptionally effective. It wasn't. So it's way too expensive for me to justify the purchase. 
12,15871,2024-10-10,taste,taste isn't bad. size is small and I needed more. I didnt feel a big difference falling or staying asleep although there was a minor difference .
13,15871,2024-09-30,middle of the night relief,"When I wake up in the middle of the night, hops tincture is my rescue.  This formula is good quality, 1 dropper dosage in a little herb tea and the taste is pleasant, not bitter. Valerian also has  wonderful benefits. Try it."
14,15871,2024-06-08,Tried for first time ,These drops have helped me get to sleep much faster and increased my deep sleep slightly. They worked much better at first but I think I’m getting used to them now. I’m only using every 2nd night now to see if I can improve their effectiveness 
15,15871,2023-11-19,Falling asleep again,"I put the suggested dosage in a small quantity of water by my bedside. When I wake up and don't go right back to sleep, I take the mixture and am able to go back to sleep. This does not taste bad."
16,15871,2023-08-24,,"I use this in combination with magnesium threonate and it helps to relax me and give me a good night's sleep. The tincture has poppy, chamomile, passionflower, lemon balm and other herbs that help relax you, which will aid in deep sleep. Make sure your not deficient in magnesium because that will also affect your sleep. If this review has helped please give a thumbs up - thanks !"
17,15871,2024-07-22,YES!!!,Good quality sleep product. Perfect blend of ingredients. I only need 30 drops along with my melatonin. I’m sleeping again. 
18,15871,2024-06-09,,"This deep sleep tincture helps promote restful sleep. It’s alcohol-free and easy to take before bed.

"
19,15871,2024-06-02,Great with mild to moderate insomnia,"Helps with mild-moderate cases indeed!
Will order again!
Thank you!



"
20,15871,2024-03-15,Good product ,Great ingredients  and the taste is quite ok. We mix it with passion fruit flower for better results. 
21,15871,2024-02-13,,good quality perfect ingredient works immediately recommend this thank-you 
22,15871,2024-02-08,It works! ,This stuff really works! I am glad I found it. 
23,15871,2024-10-09,Good formulation--I prefer the capsules,"I prefer the capsules, but this is a good formulation for sleep. And the dropper enables smaller and precise dosages."
24,15871,2024-07-01,Helps get to sleep,"Tastes good, just a dropper full in a small amount of water. Take 30 mins before you go to bed. Works well."
25,15871,2024-06-01,good,It took the edge off to de stress I just needed to take more.
26,15871,2023-01-18,,I bought this awhile back for insomnia. Works well and you don’t get a drowsy after effect in the morning. It also gives you lucid dreams. 
27,15871,2022-02-25,Great product for sleep without side effects ,"I love this sleep aid. It has quality ingredients and it’s a tincture without alcohol. I don’t do well with alcohol tinctures so I am always excited to find alcohol free options. The taste is good, I just put it in some water. I take it to help me sleep but it also works well during the day for pain relief. "
28,15871,2021-11-20,,Deep Sleep is one of the Best  Natural Sleep Aides on the market.  I love the drops.  You mix it in a little water and drink about half an hour before bedtime.  It relaxes you and helps to get you to sleep and stay asleep.  Doesn't taste so bad either!
29,15871,2024-05-31,good taste,but I had not so many benefits about the sleep 
30,15871,2023-11-01,It takes time to see sleeping quality improvement,"After I took it over 2 weeks, it started a bit improvement result. "
31,15871,2023-06-20,kind of helps,Better than nothing and definitely worth the small price tag. I wouldn't call this a game changing supplement though in terms of helping me get better sleep. 3 Brains supplement works better IMO. Pls thumbs up the review if helpful
32,15871,2022-07-23,,Seems work on me. I take only once (30 drops) 30 mins before bedtime and feel sleepy in about 5 mins. Didn’t take it as instructed as the water would wake me up in the middle of the night. Haven’t got any drowsiness in the morning. I have been suffering from long term insomnia and few sleep support products work for me. This one should be ok and I’ll try it continuously for a better review. 
33,15871,2022-01-15,,This product is very high quality and potent. The product is easy to take and you can adjust the dosage to fit your needs. It has a pleasant taste and the 1 oz. size is travel-friendly. I found that the recommended dosage was too strong for me because the ingredients are so potent. The poppy herb made me feel woozy so I cut way back and found the right dose for me that encourages relaxation and sleep without the wooziness. So I recommend starting with 1/4 of the recommended dose and then adjust the dose up or down until you find what works for you.
34,15871,2023-05-22,,oh this is truly magic in a bottle!! this is my third bottle and bought more as gifts for my loved one and they loved it. it gives u a magical sleep and waking up feeling totally refreshed and boost of good mood. 
35,15871,2022-02-26,Give it a try,No sleep formula works consistently but this is one of the better ones. A good range of ingredients including Californian Poppy which seems to be important. It's good to do a dose a bit earlier than bedtime and then again on going to bed. Definitely has a positive impact on sleep quality. Tastes ok in water.
36,15871,2021-12-13,Great Product,"This stuff is great! I take it about 30 minutes before bedtime and I am able to drift off with no problem. Unfortunately, it doesn't always help me sleep through the night, but I have terrible insomnia so that is why."
37,15871,2023-09-11,great product,this really helps me sleep better and I like that it's a liquid and absorbed quickly
38,15871,2023-09-01,,It's effective remedy that helps you to sleep and it improves the overall quality of sleeping. 
39,15871,2023-07-25,,This is perfect at bedtime to help me fall asleep. I drift into a deep sleep without any side effects. 
40,15871,2023-07-05,,"Definitely calms before bed. I use it once, but it's more effective if you use it twice before bed as per the directions. "
41,15871,2023-07-04,,I find that the Deep Sleep herbal combination helps when I have insomnia.  It is also alcohol free! 
42,15871,2023-05-29,מצוין!,Good to drink before bed. in a larger dose than what is written. A noticeable effect.
43,15871,2023-02-21,Прекрасно!,"excellent product,good and strong packaging , the quality matches the description, I will still recommend ordering to everyone!!! okay"
44,15871,2022-11-17,,Good quality and ingredients dosage are exactly for health benefit.
45,15871,2024-06-30,nope,.well packaged. didnt help. tasted funny. wont get again. small size
46,15871,2024-06-29,,"It’s okay, didn’t do anything in my opinion. The size is good for it "
47,15871,2023-10-20,didn't work,you are required to have 30 drops. I did work for me 
48,15871,2022-09-09,,"Spraying some under the tongue before sleeping, works like a charm as confirmed by my Oura ring. Around 35% more deep sleep in average. I tried so many things, I was desperate, now won’t give up this one for sure. "
49,15871,2023-03-11,,Good product. Slept well and taste was pleasant.  I’d recommend it. 
50,15871,2023-10-17,sleep well,"From 4Oct: 試左 1-2星期 中間有1-2日沒食.. 睡眠有否改善?  未深入感受到 , 本身沒嚴重失眠  是較醒瞓  或者跟夜睡和身體影響..  always 仍在試驗ing,   當然反應會因人而異, 待再稍後時間  看是否真有幫助 都會再回購
續評, 2Jul24 差不多用了一排 但真不覺特別好瞓, 還是會中間醒來且味有點難聞  只能用完算

8/Nov : 用了一月到 初起約2星期 感覺似沒醒瞓  起身比之前精神點, 期後2星期 近尾開始 5點幾醒了.. 雖未至於起身仍感倦意,  不過不可/能肯定效果到底有多少.   因人而異吧"
51,15871,2022-12-06,,I don’t know what is in this that makes me feel groggy unfortunately. I slept well with it a few times but wake up a little headache ish and feeling half asleep. Sadly not for me.
52,15871,2020-07-14,Effective at the right dosage,"I've used this product in the alcohol-based and alcohol-free versions for many years. I've found it safe and effective in helping me fall asleep when my sleep pattern is out of whack. The suggested dosage is a little high for me, and leaves me groggy the next day. I seem to do better with a single dose of 20-25 drops in water just before bedtime. As with any herbal product, your sensitivity to the herbs in the formula may vary. You may need to experiment for a few days to get the right dose and timing.  Don't give up too soon!"
53,15871,2011-05-16,Useful and alcohol free,"I use this product often, my sleep these days has not been as restful as I would like.  I find Deep Sleep helps me fall asleep, as well as get a deeper sleep.

I am 20 years clean and sober, so having a product that has no alcohol is a plus (not to mention it tastes way better to me than the alcohol-based product,for obvious reasons...)"
54,15871,2023-06-10,,These didn’t do the trick for me; the flavour is nice and I like the drop formula but didn’t help with sleep
55,15871,2023-05-30,,"Did not feel an effect taking these, the taste was not great"
56,15871,2021-01-31,Not bad,"I have a severe insomnia and herbal supplements rarely help. I must say this tincture does make me feel sleepy and makes it easier for me to fall asleep. The problem is that the effect is not lasting, so i normally wake up not much longer after and i cannot fall asleep again. It has a pleasant flavor."
57,15871,2022-09-24,,"If you follow the instructions, these herbs will help you to fall asleep fast as well as stay asleep throughout the night"
58,15871,2022-08-12,,great result!  good sleep and great energy in the morning! thank you!
59,15871,2022-05-21,מצוין!,"Very good but quiet expensive comparing to , I  i wish it would be bigger bottle and less expensive quantity "
60,15871,2021-07-26,,I have been sleeping much better since I started this. It's a really good mix of herbs and alcohol-free helps the taste. It works for me!
61,15871,2021-03-28,,"I have had difficulty falling asleep for years.
On discovering this remedy,in conjunction with liquid melatonin, I can be fast asleep and enjoy a restful night.  I love it!"
62,15871,2020-10-25,,It's my 3rd day using it and works well to me.  I could now have 4-5 hours sleep compared to the usual 2-3 hours sleep with sleeping medication. I hope it will keep working for me.
63,15871,2018-07-09,Taste really good. Works!!,"I thought I'd give it a shot. it's works, although I still wake up during the night, I somehow go back to sleep."
64,15871,2022-10-23,,Unpleasant reaction.  Stomach upset and woozy.   It may work for some but definitely not for us.
65,15871,2021-10-01,,Been using Deep Sleep for a while…it really helps me..I was having a really hard time sleeping and this plus melatonin and I finally slept!
66,15871,2021-04-10,,Easy to take. Not sure if it works or if it works because I think it does. Will have to try the whole bottle first. 
67,15871,2022-03-27,,"I bought this for my husband who has trouble staying asleep at night. The first two nights were neutral, but by the 3rd night, it kept him up all night."
68,15871,2020-05-12,This is a great product.,This is a great product. It helps me to fall asleep right away.

70,15871,2020-07-26,GREAT-TASTING RELAXER NOT SEDATIVE W/ CONTINUED CALM INTO NEXT DAY,"2nd dose is critical & many factors determine efficacy e.g. your activity
Recommended dosage is very conservative and it tastes like honey- does anyone know why? What ingredient? So good"

72,15871,2021-06-04,Excellent!  Continue to re-order,I love this product.  I add some to water at  bedtime and sleep much better.

75,15871,2020-12-07,,"the stuff didn't work on helping me sleep . I followed instructions,  30 drops in water and iv being using it , since I received it . doest work "
76,15871,2019-08-29,Waste of money,"Waste of money. I am an herbalist and I know when a medicine is potent. This is super diluted. It's not potent at all. Has a very pale color, no herbal taste...it's mostly just glycerin that you're paying for.  Would not recommend."
77,15871,2021-08-10,Good for sleep,"This one of the few supplements for sleep that actually works, too bad I´m allergic to poppy seeds!"
78,15871,2021-06-25,,"I think it helps to improve sleep quality, but I still wake up in the middle of the night"
79,15871,2021-06-25,"Unfortunately, this did not work for me.","I wanted it to work!  And the first time I took it, I thought it helped.  But I continue to wake up around 2:00 a.m. and it has not helped me sleep through the night."
80,15871,2021-05-17,,"works ok for sleep, but a bit too sweet tasting"
81,15871,2021-05-10,Not Sure Yet,"So far, I can't tell if it helps my sleep. But it has good ingredients and a pleasant flavor."
82,15871,2021-05-02,Gut,"works as good if not better than the softgels, but is fairly sweet and I recommend you take a lot toake it work."
83,15871,2020-04-24,Better products out there.,I bought this as the usual product I use was out of stock. Although it has similar ingredients it did not have the desire affect on me.
84,15871,2018-10-17,Doesn't do a thing...,"This product does not work for me at all.  It supposed to ease you before the night, well, it doesn't... Still have a problem falling asleep and stay asleep.  No use at all.  I'm still in a search of something that will make my life easier..."

107,15871,2024-10-12,Deep sleep ,"This is not the first time I order and use this brand. Dosage, Composition and Quality and ingredients are excellent, Benefits have been tested for more than one year - the best. Volume size Strengthens health. . A good assistant, a replacement for antibiotics for colds. I am happy with the quality and packaging. Improvement is already established after 7-10 days. The whole family drinks. I will order this product again"
108,15871,2024-10-08,,"I took it for my mom who has trouble sleeping. He says that the drops are very helpful, even when taken once they help to fall asleep faster and not wake up at night. And the main thing for mom is that her head is ""light"" in the morning, there are no side effects that occur from pills, and her blood pressure does not rise. Already ordered the next bottle. "
109,15871,2024-07-07,,"The quality of this product is simply the best on the market, it’s a big +, the composition is no different from competitors’ products, but I had no questions about it, the packaging is good and reliable, everything arrived intact without any defects or damage, the advantage for me is a good price for such a quality product"
110,15871,2024-05-04,Thanks to the manufacturer of this drug.,"Probably the best drug on Iherb that we have bought here. It is suitable for those who have insomnia as a result of intense work of the brain for a long time. No means helped, there was only the option of ""heavy"" sleeping pills, which could not lead to anything good. And here, perhaps, God helped - I accidentally found this drug on Iherb. After consuming the first 30 drops, the person fell asleep within half an hour, he did not even need a second dose of 30 drops. After a couple of months of taking Deep Sleep, sleep normalized, although not ideal, and now these drops are needed only for ""backup"". Practice has shown that the drug works best when observing sleep ""hygiene"": before going to bed, do not use gadgets, TV and other means that excite the nervous system. You need to go to bed on time, etc. (there is a lot of information about this on the Internet). So I can only say that I definitely recommend this drug and I want to thank its developer and manufacturer. THANK YOU!"
111,15871,2023-10-30,An excellent alternative to capsules.,"I bought capsules from this manufacturer and drops. In comparison, there is not much difference, the drops have a fairly pleasant herbal taste, you can vary the dosage, the quality of the ingredients is excellent! The bottle is small in size, you can take it with you on trips. Definitely beneficial for a quality night's rest!"
112,15871,2024-09-30,"Perfect, the best thing I bought","There is nothing to say about a great product, full of benefits, all natural, quality, and wow, and the truth is that the taste is really good. Helps to fall asleep and is not addictive"
113,15871,2024-09-18,Likes,"I have a very hard time falling asleep and turning off my head, I take it before bed and I feel relaxed, I think this set works very well. So as not to get used to it, I alternate it with other herbal sets for sleep "
114,15871,2024-07-16,Improved sleep,"I have already ordered several times. The drug has helped regulate my sleep, it has become deeper, before this I constantly woke up in the middle of the night. It gives a CALMING EFFECT Result: sweet sleep and a stable nervous system"
115,15871,2024-06-03,Excellent!,"good quality ingredient. correct size and dosage, lasts one month. certain benefit for sleep and pleasant taste. however a little expensive if used regularly but effective "
116,15871,2024-05-26,Excellent sedative for children,For a long time I was looking for drops without alcohol and containing Californian poppy. The bottle lasted for a month. I gave it half an hour before bedtime. We saw the effect immediately. I began to calm down faster in the evening and sleep longer at night. 
117,15871,2024-05-06,"Herbs Etc., Deep Sleep, alcohol-free","Improving sleep: Herbs Etc., Deep Sleep, alcohol-free can help improve sleep quality by reducing anxiety and relaxing the mind and body. Stress Reduction: This spray can help reduce stress and improve mood. Relaxation: The essential oils in this spray can help relax muscles and help you fall asleep."
118,15871,2024-04-22,"Great tool, convenient formula","The supplement has a pleasant taste, the ingredients are clear and natural, the advantage is price and quality, the packaging is stylish and beautiful, the size suits me, it is comfortable, I recommend it to everyone "
119,15871,2024-09-21,Tastes too sweet,"Too sweet, too expensive, and too complicated to eat. Originally I had to eat one hour before going to bed, and then I had to eat right before going to bed.
