0,121090,2024-07-23,Anxiety and Stress relief for dogs,"Our 2 year old American Staffy is very anxious when we leave the house, this product gives him a sense of calmness if we are going to be gone for a longer period of time. We have recently had quite a few storms and this product has been great and he has slept through majority of the noise, normally he would have run around the house. He thinks they are treats so they must taste ok, haven't tried myself :)"
1,121090,2024-09-17,It does the job.,"My dog does not like, so I have to crumble it into his food and once it kicks in he seems to be a bit calmer.  Unfortunately, I will have to search for one that he likes and will take willingly while traveling.  Other than my baby not liking these chews, it works."
2,121090,2023-12-16,Dog dependant ,"Update! These work amazing well on my younger chihuahua (1kg). Even 1/4 of a tablet brings her into a nice neutral mood. From my review below, I had to use a  different natural product (one for cushings,)which saw a vast improvement in my older dogs anxiety and her behaviour around visitors.
Quality packaging and a good list of ingredients, I haven‚Äôt really seen the benefits in my dogs behaviour yet, but maybe it will be a build up effect. As she‚Äôs gotten older my Chihuahua doesn‚Äôt deal with visitors as well as she used to, and I was hoping these would give her a bit of calm. "
3,121090,2024-06-30,Dog love it,"My beagle is  OK with eating these chews, despite the fact usually it is hard to get him swallow something medical. Not sure it changed the behaviour "
4,121090,2024-03-04,üëç,So far I think from how my pet behave if it‚Äôs taken prior the bad weather hits it does work to a minimum stage. I suppose better than giving ur pet the pet‚Äôs Valium 
5,121090,2024-08-25,Will update after using it. The price is reasonable and the packing is good.,Will update after using it. The price is reasonable and the packing is good.
6,121090,2024-07-11,chews,My dog loves the taste of these chews and it has been helpful in calming him down a bit when visitors are coming over 
7,121090,2024-07-10,Works great,Quality is good perfect for use size is fair and is packaged well benefits are good for my dog 
8,121090,2024-04-22,My dog just loves it,"Tasty snack, dog loves it, good quality and causes an improvement in dogs behaviour "
9,121090,2023-11-28,Didn‚Äôt work,"I have a 6 month old French Bulldog, just on 10lbs, she chews everything because I‚Äôm not home to watch her. I think she is teething, but I would have liked that the product slow her up after having not 3 hours later when I get home. I have a camera watching what she gets up to."
10,121090,2023-12-08,Not for my dog,"My dog became calm, but she also became blunt and confused. My guess is that it is because of the maltodextrin which isn't good for humans either."
11,121090,2024-09-26,Worked Wonders,The chews worked wonders for 1 fur baby but not for the other.  
12,121090,2024-09-04,Dog loved it.,Didn't seem to do very much for her though. Its a dachshund.
13,121090,2023-06-04,◊ò◊ï◊ë,The dogs like to chow on it.. I am not sure how calm they get but I stopped getting complaints from the neighbors 
14,121090,2024-08-10,doesnt really work,my dog is scared of thunderstorms and this didnt seem to calm her down when there was really loud thunder
15,121090,2024-09-15,,"Excellent supplement of good quality and good composition of ingredients for dogs with hyperactive behavior. I liked the taste of the tablets, the dog eats them with pleasure. The result is felt in a week. Improved sleep, the problem with behavior is still felt, but the dog has become a little calmer. We will continue to use it."
16,121090,2024-08-07,Unbelievable,"This supplement for dogs with thiamine and L-tryptophan is a real lifesaver for us in stressful situations! Our dog has always been nervous during travel, thunderstorms and fireworks, but with these chewable tablets he has become much calmer. What I particularly like is the quality of the ingredients. Ginger helps support a sensitive stomach, which is especially important when traveling. And melatonin helps our four-legged friend relax and rest. We noticed that he really felt better within 30 minutes of taking it. It is very convenient that the dose is easily adjusted depending on the dog's weight, and the tablets themselves have a pleasant taste for him. The application instructions are clear and we follow them without any problems. The quality of the product is excellent and its performance exceeded our expectations. We recommend it to all dog owners who are looking for a reliable means to reduce stress and anxiety in their pets."
17,121090,2024-09-21,Didn't come in,"My beagle didn't like them, he turned up his nose every time I tried to feed him. I crumbled them into his food, he ate them out of desperation. Diarrhea on the third day. The smell is like many pet products)"
18,121090,2024-05-02,To be seen,I haven't seen any significant improvement after taking it for a week. I hope I can see the results after finishing the whole bottle.
19,121090,2024-10-13,Really works ,"Good ingredients, good quality, taste (he seems to like it) accurate size, convenient packaging, a little smelly "
20,121090,2024-09-22,,"Excellent vitamins for older dogs. Chewable, not hard. Ours eats with pleasure and always asks for more. We give out daily "
21,121090,2024-01-01,Good product,Good product but it takes almost two hours to have a good effect on the dog
22,121090,2024-08-09,Tastes normal,Baby does not like to eat eat a row to see how
23,121090,2024-10-14,reasonable,My dog really liked the taste but made him more alert so less worked with us
24,121090,2024-07-30,I didn't understand the result,"I took it for an anxious Samoyed. She eats with pleasure, but I haven‚Äôt noticed any results. Perhaps a week is not enough"
25,121090,2024-01-19,,These pills had no effect on my dachshund at all. They didn't work at all.
