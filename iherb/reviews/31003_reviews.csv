5,31003,2024-04-20,Great but too much,"I made an error when placing my order and ordered the largest size. It was an extremely big bag, too much for me, but that's my fault. I noticed that the bag was not resealable so the product will need to be stored in some type of airtight container."

Nice green color and fresh smell not to mention taste when brewed up into a tea!  Huge bag, oat tops don't weigh that much! "

So now I stocked up on a pound of it and will make infusions at least every other night for the following day. I seems to contribute to better sleep too, and may be balancing out the digestive issue that is so linked with stress. Could it also be balancing out my adrenals too? Time will tell but in any case I love that i am boosting my intake of minerals with this natural herb. It has a gentle earthy flavor too. It has the added benefit of making my thin hair fuller and fluffier! In fact, I see the difference in my hair if I miss a day or two of drinking the tea. It is caffeine free, btw."

I bought these because I read that they are beneficial for energy levels and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. I will make nourishing infusions using the oat straw and some raspberry leaf and nettle leaf. To do this, cover the bottom of a mason jar with herbs and then add (just boiled and cooled for 1 minute) water. Let steep for at least 4 hours or overnight. Strain and then enjoy! Raspberry and nettle leaf have been good, but I am hoping the oat straw will add an extra boost."

Feels good afterward. Teeth less sensitive, mouth alkaline. Like it a lot."
205,31003,2014-06-21,YUm green and many tops,"It is very green. Many tops, not only the straw. I grind it in my coffee grinder and then I make tea, and sometimes I leave the oats in, and sometimes I strain. I reuse the oat mush in my green smoothies and shakes. It is gritty and even strawey but since the Health benefit seems so good, I just decided to eat it. In shakes it kind of disappeares with all the other gritty stuff. :) I love it. And yes, seems to have a calming and kind of healing feeling to the nerves. But it might be not more than a feeling, but since I like it, I will keep it."

209,31003,2021-06-13,,"At first, I did not enjoy the flavour of this tea ( I brew it as an infusion, 15g of herb to 750 mL of water steeped for 8 hours), but after drinking it for about a week I have grown to enjoy it.

It has a sweet grassy flavour which I think is best enjoyed iced rather than hot."
