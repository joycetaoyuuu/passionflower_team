0,104248,2024-03-19,Scaredey dog,"My four-year-old doggo, a large rescue, is scared of almost everything, the worst being rain and thunderstorms. I was sceptical at first but putting one of these bites in her wet food really does calm her down, even reducing her shaking and shivering and reducing her pacing. 

If it works for her it will work for anyone!. "
1,104248,2024-10-10,My dogs love these,"I have 2 dogs (mixed breed rescues 75-95lbs range), and they love these. I think they do help them calm down and they are always eager to eat them which is very helpful."
2,104248,2024-08-22,Good,"I think it would be a great product if my dog cared to eat it, however he doesn't seem to get on well with the taste so he hasn't eaten the whole thing for me to properly assess the effectiveness of the product."
3,104248,2023-07-13,My corgi loves these!,My 6 y/o corgi seems to love the flavor. I have only been using these for a short period of time; approximately a week to 10 days. He becomes very anxious whenever I leave the house. I generally give him two bites in the morning which seems to alleviate much of the barking upon my departure. They do not cause sleepiness. 
4,104248,2023-07-11,Works!,"I use the joint supplements from this brand and they really seem to help my 13 year-old dog. He has anxiety issues with storms and fireworks, so I picked this up to be prepared for the July 4th holiday. He has a prescription medication, but I don't like how groggy and unsteady it makes him. This seems to work well to take the edge off in anxiety-producing situations. I can then save the prescription for when his anxiety is really bad. He likes the peanut butter flavor and considers these a treat! This is a high quality brand and I've been happy with everything that I've tried."
5,104248,2022-11-04,,"I‚Äôve been using it for a week and I really believe they help my dog a bit to more calm. My dog is a teenager pitbull very energetic and overexcited about people and dogs, I got this calming bites to see if I can help with that , so far I can tell that at home she is way more calm"
6,104248,2024-04-01,Calming bites,"great range of pet supplements, i have ordered a few to try for my little one. this particular one to calm his anxiety. "
7,104248,2024-03-24,,"Not magice, but it is good enpuph for my rottwiler.
And i didnt not use more than tow a day."
8,104248,2023-09-17,Great for calming dogs naturally,I walk my dogs before sunset everyday.  Just one treat really helps them calm down and sleep well at night.  They love the taste to!
9,104248,2023-08-16,My dogs love these Peanut Butter Calming Bites!,"Every night at bedtime, the dogs gets a few of these treats.  Peanut Butter is their favorite.  These smell good & there is a good quantity in the container. The texture is good.  It helps my pups slow down and rest easy."
10,104248,2023-06-03,,"My terrier whom would rather remain terrified than take a pill, LOVES these!! No problem wth stools after either.  I will continue to purchase these."
11,104248,2023-04-25,,"Gives our dog a small amount of calm during situations that cause him anxiety. Allows him time to understand things are ok so he doesn't yelp immediately and panic. Just slows him down for a moment, which is an insane help."
12,104248,2023-09-21,No obvious difference ,"Been using it for a while now, but am not seeing any real change in my dog. Her anxiety and barking is still the same. The only thing I‚Äôm noticing is that she‚Äôs sleeping a tiny bit more on days where I gave her a calming bite. I think cbt oil might do much more for her but unfortunately that‚Äôs illegal where I live‚Ä¶ She does really like the taste of it, so I‚Äôll be using them till they‚Äôre gone. "
13,104248,2024-06-23,,Didn‚Äôt really work for my dog. It didn‚Äôt calm him down and he didn‚Äôt like the taste.
14,104248,2022-03-08,Keeps dog calm and sleeps well,"This a great treat to keep dogs calm. I have a Lab retriever who can get restless in the evening , even after exercise! She gets it once in noon and another one in dinner. I have found that it keeps her calmer and less restless in the evening. She is able to sleep soundly in her crate (9 hours) during the night, even when there are some slight noises. She is 1 year old now. I just wish this company stops using palm oil in their products.."
15,104248,2022-05-30,Â•ΩÁöÑ,"My dog seems to love it, I like the smell as well. Although the efficacy of the supplement I cannot attest to since my dog does not display calm behaviour immediately after taking it. Nonetheless I cannot verbally communicate with my dog so maybe he is calm. I keep buying this product though, I recommend."
16,104248,2022-05-03,,I have a 70 lbs mixed pit/German shepherd/mutt who is very high energy.  We give him two at a time and it takes a few hours to notice a change.  The ingredient list was far better than other brands which is why I initially decided to try Zesty Paws out.  
17,104248,2022-03-08,,"These were suggested to me as I have a dog that will destroy things while I‚Äôm at work. I come home every day at lunch to walk and feed him, so it‚Äôs only for four hours at most he‚Äôs left alone. So far it seems to help as he‚Äôs not been as destructive. "

26,104248,2021-09-05,Nice treat,"Not sure if these really calm my dog at all, sometimes it seems like they do but have a very delayed effect, like 3-4 hours later? So it makes it hard to tell for sure. But my dog loves the taste."
