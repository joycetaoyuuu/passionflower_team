0,7503,2024-10-19,,I NEED to take other sleep aides to actually fall asleep.
1,7503,2024-06-17,,"It is good but it need adjunctive to make the desired effect
"
2,7503,2010-04-30,Helps Me Sleep Longer,"A physical ailment causes me to have difficulty getting to sleep as well as waking up every few hours. Natur'es Plus, Sleep Assure, has lengthened the time I sleep uninterrupted and improved the quality of the sleep I do get. It does seem to be losing its effectiveness now after a couple months. It might be time to switch to something else for awhile. I'll probably mix it up and then go back to Sleep Assure."
3,7503,2008-04-11,The best...,"sleep aid I have ever used next to pure powdered tryptophan.  Take this Sleep Assure and in 60 minutes, or less...be ready to hit the hay...and stay asleep for at least 6 hours.  Anyone that has ever suffered from insomnia, or broken sleep patterns...give this a try.  You won't be disappointed.  I have recommended this to many...and it works every time...even with some of the worst cases."
4,7503,2016-08-24,Caution on Valerian,"I could not give this a 5 star for the following reasons:  
1) So many ""fillers"" and a few know to be difficult for the human liver and 
2) As this product has a good comprehensive approach -- plus the bi-layer technology -- and good reviews, I took a chance on it to try for myself and to possibly share with my clients (I am a health practitioner.)   

It did not work for me but here is why:   A small number of people are sensitive to Valerian and have a ""hyper"" rather than sleep response to it. I happen to be one of those.  Just want to spread awareness in case you are struggling to find a sleep remedy that works for you, you may want to try one of the many that iherb carries which do not use Valerian."
5,7503,2011-09-25,Works well in conjunction with medication.,"I wish I could eliminate medication, but my sleep problem is chronic and fierce ;)  It does a great job keeping me asleep throughout the night and not to wake up too early in conjunction with my medication.  Even medication doesn't work well for me, but together they do the trick.  I also use a sublingual melatonin and calms cal-mag drink at bedtime.  I notice a difference if any of these are missing."
6,7503,2011-04-12,Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppppppppppppppp,It is a good product to help someone to fall asleep and stay asleep. The time relase factor works great. I have awakened during the night to go to the bathroom and I fall back to sleep really quick.

11,7503,2023-12-31,,"A powerful composition of the complex with a long-lasting calming effect to combat various types of sleep disorders. Here, in addition to melatonin, it contains GABA and pyridoxal-5-phosphate, as well as herbs such as passionflower, valerian root and chamomile."
12,7503,2024-06-12,it works,The effect is good. It took effect not long after taking it.
