1,119320,2023-11-04,Awesome tea,I was so excited to see this! I love Traditional Medicinals teas and saw that they had combined a cold care tea with a night time tea and it was perfect! I had some when I was feeling a little under the weather and I like the cinammon taste and was able to sleep well so it is a win -win for me.
2,119320,2024-08-09,Works well as general cold remedy,"As a mother I was excited to see a PM version of our favorite herbal tea. We use the regular Cold Care blend as the first signs of cold symptoms. The quality of the ingredients are good, as evidenced by the taste of the tea, but we haven't noticed much in the way of assisting rest. All in all we will probably use the rest of what we have and then continue using regular Cold Care. "
