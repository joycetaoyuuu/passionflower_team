0,132404,2024-08-12,I have severe PMDD,"I got this to help combat severe emotional symptoms with my PMDD. I started taking it right after my last period. As I’m about half finished with the bottle, it works somewhat well, I usually break down 14 days before whereas with this I didn’t have a breakdown till 3 days before. Not a total improvement as my symptoms are still severe but I experienced them a bit less. A win in my book

*note: I did add this to a smoothie with other supplements like ashwagandha, and Thorne’s ovarian care powder. 

My only negative is the distribution method. I’d rather have a dropper than a pump because sometimes the pump doesn’t get anything to come out. "
