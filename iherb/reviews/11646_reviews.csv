0,11646,2024-05-17,Love this product ,"You can’t beat the quality of basic ingredients for the price. It smells great, the benefits to my skin is great. Isn’t overly soapy/full of surfactants. It smells great, doesn’t strip the skin of natural oils. The packaging is nicer than the bottles they sell elsewhere. I Love it! "
1,11646,2024-05-11,So far so good!,"I’ve heard about this product from instagram, that it really cleans the pores very well so I decided to try it. I’ve only used it once, but I have noticed how clean my pores looked and it didn’t dry my face at all. And while I was washing my face with it I saw dead skin on my finger! "
2,11646,2023-12-07,Love this!,"First time trying, and I'm hooked. Apart from the fact that it's plant based & cruelty-free, it's also Leaping Bunny Certified and has no parabens, phthalates, phthalates and sulfates.  The cleanser comes in a big bottle and is value for money. The smell is pleasant and not offensive. It gently exfoliates the skin without any harsh scrubbing and doesn't dry it out. As someone with oily skin, I'm surprised it worked really well for me. I use it every morning as it helps with removing the dullness. Will be repurchasing once I run out. "
3,11646,2023-10-23,My newly discovered skin care,"Gentle on my face with a nice gentle tropical scent, so refreshing! Just used it for a week and my pores seems calmer and my face looks and feels smoother! Will update after a month use and will repurchase if will continue to have good result!"
4,11646,2024-06-15,Very fruity scent - distinctly pineapple,"The scent is quite strong, distinctly pineapple. For me it's nice. But I didn't realize it's a clear consistency, I prefer creamy cleansers.  So sometimes I use it as a shower gel, because the size is so large it will last me a year.   
I chose it because of great composition, my skin feels really clean and fresh after. "
5,11646,2024-09-01,,"This is really good. It has a Leaping Bunny certification, seems to be free of harsh chemicals and no endocrine disruptors. The smell is pleasant and it gently exfoliates the skin without leaving it dry."
6,11646,2024-08-13,Nice facial cleanser,"It has a very light smell and does not create a lot of ""suds"", yet it still rinses off well and does a nice job of cleaning without over-stripping the skin .  "
7,11646,2024-04-09,Love It,I love this face wash! Fruit enzymes are great for my skin and this wash is offered at a great price. Great quality for the cost. 
8,11646,2024-03-07,repeat buy ,i bought this last year. it has later me 4 months. really good on my skin. easy to use. and it’s a big size hence why it’s lasted me so long. gentle on the skin and i have sensitive skin so it’s good for that too. 
9,11646,2024-01-22,Great ,"Holy grail OMG! Scent is amazing and it works well to cleans my pores from tons of sunscreen. I feel my face is cleaner and brighter after using it for few days only. Cleans well enough, but not drying. Size is huge."
10,11646,2024-01-19,,"It actually have a flavor of a pineapple 
The size is normal 
It’s good to my face you can fell the difference 
Good quality "
11,11646,2023-12-16,The best cleanser for oily skin,"I bought it again and realized how I missed it while using another good cleanser. I enjoy how clean and soft my skin feels, it's never too dry, just the excess of oil is removed. It smells awesome, fresh and not annoying. Love it!"
12,11646,2023-11-28,greattttt one!! really no kidding. the best makeup remover facial wash,"Ive been using jASONS creams for two year now and never tried their any facial soap. well its very good!! the smell is very good. it cleans my face very gentle yet very good, it removes makeup and refreshing my face!  im so ordering more. you should too"
13,11646,2023-11-10,,"really good
the scent is wonderful, sweet and calming.
love this pH blaanced enzyme cleanser. i use this occasionally with another low pH cleanser coz this has exfoliating effect"
14,11646,2023-11-01,love this facewash,"I love everything about this facewash- the scent and the quality, the price for the size, all of it! Works great for what I need it for. Fast shipping, too. "
15,11646,2023-06-01,,"Holy grail OMG! Scent is amazing and it works well to cleans my pores from tons of sunscreen. I feel my face is cleaner and brighter after using it for few days only. Cleans well enough, but not drying. Size is huge. The only problem that bottle doesn't have stopper, so I cant take it to the luggage, it will leak. "
16,11646,2022-11-11,,"I’ve been using this Givenchy face wash in the morning for a while and have been looking for a cheaper alternative. This product works well for me- a combination skin in the autumn days. It cleans well for mornings and in the meantime, doesn’t dry my skin. I love it for its value "
17,11646,2024-01-27,Gentle cleansing,"this cleanser is quite gentle on skin and does not leave your skin feeling dry and squeaky after. however, my skin gets oily quicker than usual compared to other cleansers and I am starting to see some small pimples as well. May not be good for oily skin. ingredient list seems quite clean "
18,11646,2023-01-15,,"I have super oily skin, I highly recommend it! My pores are tighter I’ve been using this product for a month now, and my face is not as greasy as before, plus Less pimples!! I do not recommend it for sensitive skin though it might be too strong and cause irritation. The size is big enough for 2 months if you use it 1/day every day. Smells fresh like lemon/pineapple it’s not too strong. Please like my comment 🙏🏻"
19,11646,2024-02-26,A bit much,"Always searching for a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin that won’t strip my skin of oils but will get the makeup off without killing my eyes. This didn’t do the trick. I’m still sticking with coconut oil followed by a wet, hot exfoliating towel."
20,11646,2023-08-21,,I love this stuff! Leaves my skin feeling fresh and squeaky clean. I have sensitive skin so I don’t use it daily just to be on the safe side. My skin always looks refreshed and rejuvenated after using. I use 2-3 times a week. Smells wonderful and is a great pore cleanser too. 
21,11646,2024-09-13,use it at shower,also smells very good i love this product and i reccommend this to everyone here
22,11646,2024-08-26,really good cleanser,"I absolutly love it! its light and not stiky, works wonders on spots and uneven skin tone"
23,11646,2024-08-13,Love it,Bought it a few times now. Really refreshing and good value. 
24,11646,2024-07-30,Прекрасно!,"excellent product,good and strong packaging , the quality matches the description, I will still recommend ordering to everyone!!! okay"
25,11646,2024-07-18,So far ok,"So far ok and acceptable when used. I dont encounter any issues when I use this, so it is acceptable."
26,11646,2024-07-08,great,my daughter loves this face wash good quality and very good size she uses daily 
27,11646,2024-05-24,will buy again,"love this enzyme cleanser, it's gentle but brightens my skin

32,11646,2024-04-14,,Smells nice. Clean well so far. I’ve been using it for a while and it’s been working well for me
33,11646,2024-04-11,Really good!,"I have used this product for a long time. I like how my face feels when I use it, very clean!"
34,11646,2024-03-29,gentle,gentle cleanser that leaves the skin moisturized. just a little bit goes a long way so don't use too much
35,11646,2024-03-28,Shower essential!,A staple for me....face glows and feels clean but never dry!!
36,11646,2024-03-27,Favorite cleanser! ,Mild fragrance and gentle cleansing. Not greasy. I use morning and evening. 
37,11646,2024-03-22,Amazing! ,"I love it. 
Removing my makeup with no problem at all"
38,11646,2024-03-19,Works Wonderful,Works Wonderful.  Cleans my sensitive skin well every day & does not dry it out.  No harmful ingredients.
39,11646,2024-03-19,,"My daughter loves it! Good ingredients, nice smell, buying it again. "
40,11646,2024-02-26,,"Love it , good quality and size and makes my skin smooth"
41,11646,2024-02-18,Good,"I always buy this product, it works great for me."

43,11646,2024-01-27,,I love Alba products and this one was excellent too.  Cleans without drying too much.
44,11646,2023-11-12,Great!,Cleans facial skin gently. Smells like pineapple. I'm quite happy with it.
45,11646,2022-07-04,,I found this face wash very good and not irritated my sensitive skin. The fragrance is very pleasant. The size is great and it has a pump which is so easy to use. The only disadvantage I found is that you can not close the pump if you want to pack the soap for a trip. 
46,11646,2022-01-06,,"It smells really good and is pretty liquid and does not have any ""heavy"" texture. You can feel the well quality ingredients in it. 
I have a very reddish sensitive skin and this product makes you skin shinny and clean. 
Will definitely purchase it again.

47,11646,2023-06-18,,"Packaging was good as when it arrived there was no leakage or spillage. I like the bottle, it’s easier to be able to pump the product. What I don’t really like is the smell. As its flavor is pineapple enzymes, it smelled like fermented pineapple. If you are okay with the smell then it’s okay I guess. Size lasts you 3 months at least. "
48,11646,2023-05-06,,"Size is great and I like the scent, and I guess it’s an okay with okay quality, but lots of the time my face is left feeling not entirely clean.
That said, I haven’t experienced excessive breakouts, so it might just be a feeling.
Important to note: I have oily-combination skin, I use it once a day because I only cleanse at nighttime and I’m 25."
49,11646,2024-09-15,,"fine quality, I prefer alba botanica normal face cleanser, this might cause slight irritation "
50,11646,2024-06-02,,"Works good, smells tropical. only bad thing is it leaves very tiny bumps on my neck"
51,11646,2024-04-20,,"Gentle, pineapple enzyme exfoliating facial cleanser very good for oily skin very gentle "
52,11646,2024-04-07,Love the smell,"Beautiful pineapple scents, really nice and light on the skin. Arrived quickly and packaged well ."
53,11646,2024-03-19,,I think it leaes the skin a little dry. nice package and easy to use
54,11646,2024-03-16,Lighten up,I have it for one year it is ok but has fragrance on it 
55,11646,2024-01-15,good,sweet flavor. I used it frequently each evening. good size of the package.
56,11646,2023-12-30,,Smells good from the pineapple; fresh feeling and gentle on skin 
57,11646,2023-12-03,טוב,Nice smell a bit small package not the best shampoo 
58,11646,2023-10-09,Great cleanser ,It works well for my son’s acne. It cleanse well and leave his skin with sufficient moisture after cleansing. He loves it very much and will continue to use it for daily cleaning. 
59,11646,2023-09-19,Amazing,I've been using this face cleanser for a few years and it's my favorite cleanser. It gently cleanses your skin without drying out your skin. It lasts a long time.
60,11646,2023-09-16,Very good,"Love this cleanser, works equally well on teenagers and adults with a normal to oily skin. Might be too much for a dry skin though"
61,11646,2023-07-25,Excellent Product,Been using this product for years - always bought at Winners (Canada) but no longer available - I'm glad to have found it on i-Herb quite by accident.  A drop on a sponge to cleanse makes my skin very soft.
62,11646,2023-07-13,,"It is a generous size, just 1-2 pumps to use, it is non foamy texture and gentle enough, however as if you got sensitive skin I would recommend you use twice a week and you do need moisturize after"
63,11646,2023-06-16,,I have used alba's soap for a while now. It's the first time I'm using this scent.  I like it. I recommend it 
64,11646,2023-03-13,,Beautiful smell face wash. Great price. Using it as face and body wash for my oily skin. Removes the oil without making my skin feel dehydrated. 
65,11646,2023-02-26,Good stuff,"I have used this Hawaiian cleanser for a couple of months, and I really like it.  The pineapple scent is very pleasant and it does a great job of cleaning my face.  This will be my go to cleaner."
66,11646,2023-01-09,My favorite...,"I have been purchasing this for years and will continue to do so. It smells amazing and is has been great on my sensitive skin. I love it, truly."
67,11646,2022-12-09,,"This is one of my most favourite cleansers to use. It cleans well but gentle on the skin. 
Love this face wash, it cleanses the pores and skin thoroughly without leaving it dry. Really cleaned my face, it help to reduce open pores and black heads"
68,11646,2022-11-16,,Love this! Obsessed with Pineapple at the moment and this smells amazing! Gentle enough for everyday use I’ve found but also non drying and leaves skin feeling fresh. Would get again :)
69,11646,2024-09-29,Formula Changed,"The quality of the formula changed, it used to be a gentle cleanser now it feels harsh on skin. Stay away from this product especially if you have sensitive skin. "
70,11646,2023-10-17,a little too watery,"I bought this to use in the shower, but the consistency was too watery. Half the cleanser dribbles off my hand before it reaches my face. It was also maybe too gentle where my face didn't feel very cleansed after using it. 

The scent was pretty light and I trust that alba uses quality ingredients, but this was not for me. I generally like alba products so it was a bit disappointing."
71,11646,2022-07-18,,Omg no flavor please don’t taste it ! I use it twice a day . Enough size for 2 months . Yeah any age can use it no harm . It benefits me with cleansing well . It is soft and gentle. Good composition. Great quality but liquid more than it should be if it was thicker would be better . Also package can be better . 
72,11646,2024-09-26,good one,Its a good one. But can be used for long time. End up with dry skin especially during winter.  
73,11646,2024-09-22,Average ,Gentle facial cleanser that barely has any foam and yet moisture. More likely for sensitive skin condition. 
74,11646,2024-07-11,Somehow allergic,Tried a couple times and found out my facial skin was allergic to it’s ingredients. Smell was good though!
75,11646,2023-12-23,A bit too rough ,"I usually like Alba's products, but after using this a couple of time it really dried up my skin"
76,11646,2023-10-22,Okay,"Not my favorite, was okay nothing special at all not memorable either. Wouldn’t buy it again "
77,11646,2023-08-08,Prettier helper in my house,"My domestic helper asked me to buy this item. She has dark skin and some pigmentation on her face. After using this item to wash her face for about a month, I can see that there is less visible pigmentation in her skin."
78,11646,2023-07-13,Great,"First time using this facial cleanser.  It doesn't lather well for me. However, based on the ingredients, I will repurchase again. if you don't care about product lathering, I highly recommend it."
79,11646,2022-10-11,,"The scent is strong feels like a good quality the size fit the description do not use if you have sensitive skin I use it with Alba Botanica, Acnedote, Oil Control Lotion and it made my skin peel (I have oily skin) so after using it I put another regular moisturizer and the combination is amazing! It is Amazing to have Alba Botanica in iHerb. This is becoming my favorite brand!
"
80,11646,2022-07-31,Nice scent! Amazing face wash!,"Bought this as a gift for a friend and he loves it so much! He mentioned that the scent is great, wash is gentle and he feels moisturized. I noticed how dry his skin was and decided to purchase this as a gift as he loves anything Hawaiian too. He use it daily and twice a day."
81,11646,2022-07-16,,"This is my everyday cleanser.  I have normal and mildly sensitive skin. 
 I find it non-drying but cleans well with good lather.  As the fruit enzymes help to remove dead skin cells and tighten the pores, my skin looks brighter and smoother after washing.  It is gentle enough to be used twice a day.  I am totally satisfied."
82,11646,2022-02-13,,great quality product. it really works as intended. Will definitely get more soon! Thank you so much for this. it was made of high qualiy ingredients. Plus the packaging and sizes were perfect. over all good quality. i love the smell and the looks of it. im looking forward to purchasing another one!
83,11646,2021-12-01,,"Awesome cleanser that can transform the skin due to mild yet very effective action of enzymes in it. Some times per week in the evening I like to apply it on the previously cleaned from makeup skin and leave it there while I am showering. The enzymes this way have more time to work and the effect  can be compared to an exfoliating mask. I love everything about this product, and happy to find it on iHerb."
84,11646,2022-08-09,جيد,"fresh scent. lathers well, one pump brings out more than what you need for a single face and neck wash so be careful, it lasts for quite sometime but if you have dry skin, it can slightly dry it even  more so you will experience some dry patches. it gives a nice glow when used consistently 
mom who has a mature skin likes it.
good product and comes well sealed"
85,11646,2022-02-23,Great for sensitive skin,"Packaging: The new look took me a bit by surprise. I know that it is what it is, and sometimes you have to change, but I didn't see any reason to change the bottle. 
The new format, my sponge, which is supposed to be hanging on the top of it, it slides right off. 

Quality and composition: In terms of ingredients, seems like the same ones as before, so I hope that my face will feel the same, which was not dry and fresh. I have sensitive skin, so this always worked. I'm glad that iherb is carrying it. 

Smell: it smells fantastic! "
86,11646,2009-11-20,Wonderful.,"Before I bought this I used scrubs both in the morning and evening as I only ever felt my skin was truly purely cleansed this way. I knew this wasn't great for my skin so I searched for a cream/gel cleanser and every one I tried didn't take all my makeup off or left me with dull skin, but my search has stopped with the Alba pineapple enzyme cleanser. It is gently clarifying and gives me the same results as I get with scrubs without being abrasive. I've gone from using scrubs twice a day to once a week and my skin looks clear and fresh. Smells lovely, great for sensitive skin and rosacea. Just make sure you shut your eyes when you wash with this and don't open them till you've rinsed off well otherwise ouch!"
87,11646,2023-10-09,Good!,Gentle but thorough. Removes makeup well for the most part (mascara maybe not completely). Have been using about a year and will continue to!
88,11646,2023-10-01,Perfect,Very clean but feels dry after washing out. It is not much more bubbly and smells so good.
89,11646,2023-09-21,love it!!!,"love the smell, love the brand. very good for my skin.  no allergies. no strong smell. highly recommend. love it!!!!"
90,11646,2023-09-11,,"Washes my skin well, smells good and lasts for long period of time ! "

93,11646,2023-07-28,,I haven’t used it yet but have high hopes that it will be good

112,11646,2022-11-13,,"Alba botanica is great! This cleanser really cleans well with the help of enzymes, really good for oily and combination skin. "

115,11646,2022-10-26,,Like it very much.  Packaging is different from before but feels good.  Will purchase again
116,11646,2022-10-26,,"like all of this company products, great value for great quality. the scent is really nice. love using it. "
117,11646,2022-10-23,,"Excellent face wash with very pleasant scent. I’ve been using it for a few months, and happy about it. "
118,11646,2024-10-05,Ordered by mistake.,I like Alba's other products but not this one. It's too harsh for my skin.
119,11646,2024-04-24,nice,"Nice face wash very average.Didn't really feel like it was doing anything more
Average quality I used it daily"
120,11646,2024-03-03,Not happy ,"Doesn’t work as other good cleansers, waste of money. Less chemical scent, which was good."
121,11646,2022-08-21,,"Smells amazing! sulfate-free, natural and sustainable ingredients. I use their face products, their sunscreen, their hair products, and this products works as promised. Contains nutrient-rich plants. This cleanser doesn’t disappoint at all, great VFM as well."
122,11646,2022-04-08,,"I love it, but it came in a different package. The smell is so much like a real pineapple. The ingredients are good on the whole for the product u wash off the face. Might not be strong enough for water-resistant make up. "
123,11646,2021-11-16,,This is one of my most favourite cleansers to use. It cleans well but gentle on the skin. Have to clean twice to get that squeaky clean feeling.
124,11646,2023-07-26,טוב,"feels good in the shower. however, it contains a lot of  perfume. the smell is great but really unnecessary in my opinion"
125,11646,2022-11-20,,I use this product in-between exfoliation to keep skin clear and soft. 
126,11646,2022-11-01,좋음,very good.suiatable for humid summer. also works great after oil massage. handy pakage too.
127,11646,2022-10-22,High quality cleanser,"Beneficial for mixed skin type, cleanses nicely with herbal ingredients & wonderful scent !"
128,11646,2022-05-17,Not Foamy!,I was a little disappointed with the consistency of this cleanser. PLEASE LEAVE A THUMBS UP IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW. Thank you! I wasn't expecting that it has a light and thin suds. It has a very light scent of pineapple too. I think it cleanses right but if you like foamy or soap suds like me I think you will not enjoy it.
129,11646,2021-11-06,,"My son and wife used this up quickly. They loved it. They just wish it came in bigger sizes. It smelled really nice, and seemed to be a quality product. Alba Botanica seems to offer great products. I think they would like to order this facial cleanser again very soon."
130,11646,2021-01-27,,"this one cleanse the face well, it is refreshed, purified.  cleaned yet not dry, one bottle last for over half year!  i just feel bored when using the same cleanser for over half year, can they make smaller bottle?   the smell is good, gel like texture is good for the summer. "
131,11646,2020-07-05,Love it!,"I have never used this face wash before, I read the other reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I have very oily skin, after the first use I noticed a difference. This face wash makes my skin feel so soft, smooth and fresh without leaving it feeling dry or stripped of natural oils."
132,11646,2019-11-12,Amazing Product!,I’ve been looking for a product for years to battle my acne. I don’t suffer from severe acne however the acne I did have has almost completely disappeared with the use of this product as well as a non-alcoholic toner and a moisturiser. Highly recommend this product to anyone with acne. Leave on your face for 3-4 minutes for a better outcome and use 3-4 times a week. I use it 4-5 times a week as I have extremely oily skin but you don’t want to completely wipe your natural oils away. This product is honestly amazing.
133,11646,2018-04-24,Favorite facial cleanser ,Favorite favorite facial cleanser. My skin is very sensitive and I've never managed to find anything that makes me feel clean but doesn't irritate me or break me out until this one! I've been using faithfully for 3 years and will probably keep using for another 300 more. 
134,11646,2015-10-07,Alba Botanica - Facial cleanser Pineapple Enzyme,"I  bought this facial cleanser after reading the great reviews on Iherb and on different internet forums. I used it for approx 4 weeks now, usually in the evening. It does pretty well its job when it comes to removing the makeup (I do not use heavy makeup; I use only BB cream). It is gentle for my skin, it doesn't make my skin feel tight. I like the smell of this product. I only need a small amount of the product to wash my face, so I suppose that it will last for a long time. I will buy it again!"
135,11646,2014-08-27,Alba Botanica Facial Cleanser,"Great cleanser: Smells wonderfully of pineapples and makes my face really clean. Easy to rinse off. It actually gives my face a nice glow and seems to smooth out and make pores less visible. This bottle is going to last for a long time, I only have to use a tiny amount for my entire face. Recommended!"
136,11646,2014-05-10,"A Great Cleanser, I love it!","I love this cleanser. I have very sensitive skin that can also be a bit dry. I was worried that this cleanser might be harsh and irritate my skin. I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't really smell like Pineapple, smells more like Grapefruit maybe. It is a nice tropical scent. I also love the packaging of all of Alba's products. This is the second time I have purchased this cleanser. I will use this one all the time now. I won't be changing. "
137,11646,2014-04-15,Fantastic,"I have what I would call, the most sensitive skin ever. I can hardly use any products without breaking out in any sort of rash. I saw how natural the ingredients in this product were and I thought it seemed like a good idea. 
I have not had any problems with it so far. It smells great, which is a good start, it lathers up quite nicely when I vigorously rub it between my fingers/palms and it doesn't dry my skin out. 
This is a great cleanser but I don't think it's for everyone as I could see that for some it would be too gentle. "
138,11646,2014-01-09,great for dry and sensitive skin <3,"
I tend not to use soap for face, only cleansing milk and cleansing cream. but this soap are fabulous. I love this. I have sensitive eyes and i use contact lenses. This soap is very gentle to my eyes, does not hurt when it came to the eyes.


My face are properly clean and smell so fresh like a real hawaiian girl :)"
139,11646,2011-11-17,Wonderful,"I've tried many cleansers in all price ranges over the years and I have to say this one's the best I've found! It cleanses very thoroughly, but is not too drying - at least not for my oily skin type. I suffer from rosacea and acne, and after switching to this stuff I've had no breakouts at all and the rosacea is noticeably better too. My skin looks fresh and feels so soft! The scent is great and it lathers up nicely. I'll definitely order another bottle before this one is empty!"
140,11646,2011-11-03,great stuff,"This is just as good as everyone here says. It totally removes all the makeup in a way I have not seen even the most expensive cleansers do. And it won´t leave the skin dry, I do not have to use moisturizer afterwards. And my skin is normally very dry! I highly recommend this, it is also quite affordable!"
141,11646,2010-09-15,Fantastic Cleanser!,"I have mature, combination acne-prone skin and started using the Alba Botanica skin care line several months ago.  The combination of these products has really helped balance out my skin and now I only occasionally suffer from a very minor monthly break out, if any.  Honestly, my skin hasn't been this happy for several years - I'm just thrilled with the results this line has given it!  This cleanser really helps get rid of the daily grime and makeup and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  I would Highly Recommend this cleanser and line along with iHerb - their prices just can't be beat! "
142,11646,2022-05-23,"Good for shaving, but packaging needs work. ","Good facial wash for shaving, but the packaging could be improved. I have trouble getting the last bit out, and the tall bottle makes travel difficult without bumming the nozzle and causing a spill. But otherwise it is a good cleaner with subtle and sensitive friendly fragrance. "
143,11646,2022-04-30,,"overall this product is nice. 
i use it every day.
it smells fruity.
it doesnt foam.
its quite gentle on the skin.
i would like to say that it could be a nice cleanser for someone with sensitive skin.
BUT everyone reacts differently to skin products.
"
144,11646,2022-09-11,,"Great cleanser! Natural great smell! 
It’s fits to mixed skin so it’s perfect for season change 
Love it"
145,11646,2021-11-24,,"I love tht it's gentle, contains aloe and orange. Natural ingredients and uplifting citrus. "
146,11646,2021-07-20,Definitely worth a try.,At first I wasn't too sure as on the first try my skin did tingle and I wondered whether I was allergic to this new cleanser. But no reaction happened after I washed it off or since then after multiple uses. It smells great and very unique PLUS you barely have to use 1/2 a teaspoon amount to cover the whole face. So I think this bottle is going to last ages! Great value for a good product.
147,11646,2021-03-01,Gentle yet effective!,"I love this cleanser. I needed something to clear up my teenage son’s skin while at the same time being gentle with it and this did the job excellently! It smells amazing, too. I’ve used it on my skin a few times as well and was pleasantly surprised by how gentle it is. My skin is picky with its cleansers but seems to love this one! "
148,11646,2020-12-22,,"Don't know how many bottles of this cleanser I have used, I can't imagine my skincare without it. It's gentle and doesn't irritate my skin, but also can remove my makeup. It doesn't sting or irritate my eyes so I can use it for removing my eye makeup too. Can't recommend it enough."
149,11646,2020-06-22,Perfect formula for clear skin,"This facial wash has a great scent and has really helped clear my skin of a stress breakout (hello, 2020!) in just about a week of use.  Not a lot of foam but just enough to feel it is doing its job.  Rinses clean in warm water leaving  no sticky residue.  Very happy with its performance and wonderful scent."
150,11646,2016-11-17,I love it!,"My skin is very sensative but still need some good clean. No irritations, no dryness!!!  At first I was afraid of using natural enzyme but it works perfectly on my skin. The only one tip for ladies who have the same skin type - use the prodact in the evening. For mornings better use something simple, your skin doesn't need a deep clean after night. "
151,11646,2015-08-28,Drying even on oily skin,"I have used the other cleansers by Alba Botanica and they worked very well. This one smells funny (like a fake sweet scent, not like pineapple or grapefruit at all) and has a runny texture. I use it only at night but it's starting to dry my skin out. I have combination, sensitive skin that is prone to congestion. So any skincare with fruit acids are my best friends as they help to unclog those pores. This one is not for me. "
152,11646,2014-04-10,Very good,"I don't wear makeup so I can't say how good this is at removing it, but it cleanses my face of oils and dust from air pretty well. The skin doesn't feel tight at all after I rinse it off, which is great. I find that most cleansers either dry it out too much or don't feel cleansing enough, but this one is great. 
I use this with a silicone massage/cleansing pad to have a gentle peeling, but as far as unclogging my pores goes, my skin is always about the same, mixed with a lot of clogged pores but rarely any pimples. So this didn't magically make my skin look perfect, but it feels good nevertheless."
153,11646,2014-02-03,Great for Oily skin,"My skin is generally very oily, and this is great for cleaning all that excess oil off of my face!  I wouldn't recommend it for dry skin, and I definitely suggest using moisturizer along with this product.  But really great.  I love the smell, and the packaging is rather appealing as well!"
154,11646,2013-10-03,Soft and lovely ,"That is how your face will feel after you use this. I will not use anything else to wash my face since I started using this about a year ago. You don't need to use a lot either, to get your face clean. ( a washcloth will add a little exfoliation if you feel you need it). "
155,11646,2012-05-01,"NIce product, but smells too much and is very thin and runny. ","The product is thin and watery, but is cleanses well. I use it in the morning, twice a week. Other days I use other products. 
Smells more like citrus fruit, and to me the smell could definitely be more delicate. Nothing exceptional, but I would recommend it, as my skin feels clean after this product. I'm 25 and have a combo skin. "
156,11646,2012-02-17,Nice!,"I've been using this as my daily cleanser for month and it is really nice!
It does not dry my skin.
I can't use it to erase my make up but its great when I use it in the morning or on the days I didn't wear make up. "
157,11646,2011-09-01,Excellent product,For years I had been using Jan Marini Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser and getting the desired results. But it costs $30/8oz bottle. A friend suggested this Alba Botanica product at just $8/8oz bottle. Not only does it it gently exfoliate but it smells great and leaves my face soft and smooth. I definitely recommend this cleanser! Don't waste your money on any other facial cleanser!
158,11646,2011-08-21,I love this Product,"I have oily-combination skin and this product is wonderful. It dries my skin out without making it too dry. I don't feel a lot of oil sitting on my skin in the middle of the day like before.  I can even go without washing my face twice a day and my skin still won't get overly oily.

I read a lot of reviews that commented on how the product got into theirs. I've never experienced this problem and I was directly over my eyes."
159,11646,2011-03-06,Alba Botanica pineapple enzyme facial cleanser Hawaiian hypo-alergenic,"I am very pleased with the results of this cleanser. I have consumed several 8-ounce bottles of this cleanser during the past couple of years. I will continue to use this cleanser. I use it on my face and neck. It works very well for me by helping to keep my skin clean and clear. The cleanser also helps to keep my skin moist and soft better than any other cleanser that I have tried. In the shower I use my favorite bar of bath soap from head to toe to soap down, lather, and rinse. After the rinse, I wash my face and neck with Alba Botanica pineapple enzyme facial cleanser, which makes a noticeable difference in the appearance and feel of the skin on my face and neck. My skin looks and feels better than if I do not use this cleanser. My skin feels very clean."
160,11646,2023-04-17,,"Eeffectively cleanses, its scent was overpowering and not to my preference. Overall, a decent product, but not for those sensitive to strong fragrances."
161,11646,2022-12-31,Okish,"it didn't dry up my skin, other than that didn't strike me as particularly great."
162,11646,2022-08-20,,this face wash is refreshing with a nice scent. it feels good on sensitive skin it isn't drying and cleans well. it's gentle and has good quality ingredients 
163,11646,2021-02-03,,"I was hoping this could take the place of another pineapple cleanser I fell in love with from a pricier brand. But sadly this seemed to irritate my skin. It definitely sounds like it should do the opposite, so I think I just have super-sensitive skin & something in this didn't agree with me. Lathers well. Smells nice! Reminds me of those smarties candies that always seemed to appear in the 80s & 90s. "
164,11646,2020-12-13,,"I use this to clean my face after removing eye makeup with an oily face cleanser.  My face feels really clean after I use it.  It smells good although, sometimes it's a bit overwhelming.  It lasts forever, because you need just a tiny bit to clean your entire face."
165,11646,2019-11-14,Love this,Love this. Lovely clean feeling but non drying - the dispenser is a bit generous so I try to only use 1/2 a pump at once otherwise you end up with too much product.
166,11646,2019-05-05,not drying and refreshing,"use as morning cleanser. I have oily skin, its not drying and still refresh & clean my face. smell fruity and price in good value too."
167,11646,2018-09-01,Nice cleanser,"It's nice, not super. However this is not a first time I ordered the cleanser. I like the smell, and that my skin is fine after it. For 20 years old girl this is fine product."
168,11646,2016-12-09,Lovely Cleanser For Oilier Skin,"If you have skin that tends towards oily I think this could be a lovely cleanser for you. You can really feel the pineapple enzymes, it left my skin feeling very clean and fresh. However on my drying ageing skin it did leave me feeling a bit dry, and I'd probably only use this on days when I've loaded up my face with greasy sunscreen and want a good deep clean. But if your skin gets oily and clogged I imagine this could be a lovely everyday cleanser. "
169,11646,2015-04-06,love love love,"By far, the best cleanser I have ever used. It perfectly cleans the skin, without drying it even a bit. It brightens it and leaves it fresh and clean. I use it once daily "
170,11646,2012-10-22,Pretty good,I wanted to try this for my rosacea. It's too harsh for my cheeks (where my rosacea is the worst) but it helped clear out some blackheads from my nose. Now I use another face wash for the rest of my face and this just on my nose. It will last a while just for that so I'm still happy I tried it :)
171,11646,2012-08-22,Soft and gentle cleanser.,"Cleanser is gentle on eyes and soft to the skin. Feels like it realy disolves oil, dirt, etc. I'm buying it 3-d time in a row."
172,11646,2022-10-19,,Great product! Fully complies with the described criteria and qualities indicated on the label!
173,11646,2022-10-07,,"Amazing product, will use again , great quality, nice size , nice scent "
174,11646,2022-10-07,,"Love this product, It leaves my face clean and soft."
175,11646,2022-09-28,,"Refreshing, cool cleanser. I use it after cleansing oil and it removes it and cleaned my pores very good. And I loooove the flavor 
"

180,11646,2022-05-16,,Great size and brightens my face! I like it and will buy again. Doesn’t dry out the skin! 
181,11646,2022-05-07,,this makes my skin really soft and bright my new favorite face wash

184,11646,2022-03-11,very good soap,I am very pleased with the feel and appearance of my facial skin after using this soap.
185,11646,2022-03-02,,"After using for one week, I can see new transformation of my skin.  nice fragrant and gentle on skin.  "
186,11646,2022-02-25,,Smell divine and feel so clean not dry up after
187,11646,2022-02-15,,"Amazingggggg !!!! Super gentle and since i started, blackheads are not forming as fast as it used to form. Love it"

189,11646,2022-02-04,,Great for removing makeup and feeling so clean.  Love the smell!
190,11646,2022-01-06,,I like the products of the company. They are natural and ecologically friendly. The smell is incredible
191,11646,2021-11-08,,"Gentle to the skin, even sensitive skin can use this product.  Apply a tiny amount on the face and massage gently for great results."
192,11646,2013-12-01,USED to work,"This changed my skin for the better for the first month or two but now I find it dries out my skin a little. It's not the worst and I DO have dry skin to begin with so the problem is partly to do with my skin type. I just don't know why it's suddenly stopped hydrating my face, I haven't been doing anything different. Not much to say except it used to work but not anymore. Will only use it occasionally from now on."
193,11646,2021-10-03,,"bought it for my husband, he has an oily skin and this cleanser not just clean the oil away, but also help to provide some hydration to his skin. after using this cleaser, my husband has way lesser pimples than before. "
194,11646,2021-03-18,I love this facewash,"This is a great enzyme face wash for a deep clean. I actually use the entire line from this brand from this line the scrub, mask and the other facewash. All are great products."
195,11646,2021-02-26,,"Love this face wash, it cleanses the pores and skin thoroughly without leaving it dry. Awesome in the summer, or warmer months, OR if you have oily skin."
196,11646,2021-02-23,,Like it and I will repurchase it. Nothing to complain about it! Cleans and does not dry the skin. Exactly what it supposed to do.
197,11646,2021-01-31,,This cleanser is one of my must-haves. It helps to clean my pores in a very delicate and effective way and I love how it smells. Fantastic product!
198,11646,2021-01-30,,"This is a great product.
It gently cleanses all make up and does not sting, burn, or dry my skin.
After using this product my skin feels silky smooth.  I use it with my clarisonic and it works great. 
It smells amazing but not artificial.
I bought two bottles."
199,11646,2021-01-25,My skin is clean more than before,"The texture is not milky, is watery, i think it is good for summer, boy or girl, everyday i use it for morning sooo refreshing 
"
200,11646,2021-01-22,,I have very sensitive skin and I have used this product for years.  Works great as I can't use soaps. All the Alba products are great.
201,11646,2020-11-30,new fave,I’m picky with my skin products but I’m a sucker for anything pineapple so I had to give this a try - I use a little silicon face scrubber with this & my skin has honestly never looked & felt better. It’s baby soft 
202,11646,2018-05-16,mild cleaner and main moisture skin after wash,"mild cleaner good for morning time only, i think it's not suitable for night time not that deep clean i am a bit oily."
203,11646,2017-06-11,great facial wash,Love this cleanser as it does not dry my skin and have great fruits sense.  cleanse my face well and it's botanical and organic. Love it..
204,11646,2016-10-24,Everything you need!,"I've tried a lot of expensive cleansers, but this facial cleanser is perfect for my combination/dry skin. It smells great, removes all make up and dirt, and leaves you with a clean feeling. My skin has never felt softer!"
205,11646,2013-08-05,Good quality,"I have gotten compliments since using it as it brightens and evens my complexion. It does not sting my skin [combinaton and sensitive]. I sometimes use it with a face brush alike the Tosowoong, it lathers nicely."
206,11646,2013-06-19,mild yet effective cleanser that last forever:),"i have very sensitiv skin prone to breakouts, itching and whatnot. this cleaner did not irritate my skin at all. it cleanses without leaving skin stripped. "
207,11646,2012-11-04,Pineappley,I like this product a lot. It has a gentle smell of pineapples and it doesn't dry my skin out. It doesn't produce much foam and it rinses nicely. Try it out.
208,11646,2012-04-12,Very good cleanser,This cleanser does not dry up my skin and lathers very well too.  Face feels very refreshed and clean.  Use it twice a day in the morning and night.  Will definitely buy it again.
209,11646,2012-02-06,Great cleanser,"Cleanses well and smells good. My skin feels only a tiny bit tight after using it, but this is usually worse with other cleansers that contains a lot more oils."
210,11646,2012-01-20,"Smells great, cleanses really well.","I love this face wash. It leaves my face clean and removes all makeup gently, doesn't overdry and smells fantastic. One one squirt is more than enough to wash my face with, so the bottle will last a long time. Nice packaging too! Will repurchase for sure!"
211,11646,2010-12-13,Fantastic Product ,"Bought this twice now. I love the tropical punch scent and it leaves my skin really clean, but not dry. Foams up nicely, so you only need a small amount. Good value for money!"
212,11646,2010-11-30,"Wonderful, fresh light scent!",I am enjoying washing my face with this cleanser.  It's a nice product and very good value - just a tiny bit (dime size) is enough for each wash. 
213,11646,2009-04-28,Perfect and easy to use,I'm surprised this facial cleanser is so easy to use.  Does not dry out the skin too much. Clean and fresh with a crisp fragrance.  
214,11646,2009-03-17,Fun cleanser you can feel working,"I bought this to complement the Dessert Essence Tea Tree cleanser I already use, and the scent and cleaning feeling do not disappoint. What a happy way to start the day! Use a moisturizer afterwards, because this does get your skin clean...which can lead to dryness."
215,11646,2022-05-31,Good ,"Scent is great.. doesn’t lather much but cleanses your skin, gentle enough for sensitive skin"
216,11646,2022-03-11,nice,a nice clenser - great price. im not a fan of artificial fragrance bit its smells nice
217,11646,2022-01-31,Smells good,I live the smell and the fact that its vegan friendly but I don’t think it really cleans the face well
218,11646,2022-01-13,,"great cleanser, skin feels shiny and healthy after use.
only cons is that it didnt come with a pump.
"
219,11646,2021-12-20,,"Face looks glowing after wash, followed with moisturizer to maintain the glow"
220,11646,2021-10-24,,We like all the Alba products and I got this for my teen boys.
221,11646,2021-07-25,,"Love this stuff, just ordered two more bottles because I ran out. It's gentle and removes makeup."
222,11646,2021-03-15,,"Liked this face soap. I think because there are pineapple enzymes in it, it does a bit of a chemical peel and leaves your skin really smooth, but it's still gentle and not drying. I also later saw that the package is from recycled plastic which is great because I was slightly bummed out by the plastic package at first. "
223,11646,2013-02-08,Fell alittle bit short on my expectations ,"
   I like cleansers that foam reasonably and those that leave my skin feeling fresh, light and clean.. 
but this one I guess is good for sensitive skin in the sense that it doesn't leave me feeling as light and fresh as i like to.. its a bit ""too"" gentle.. 
"
224,11646,2023-09-30,Bad,Alba botanica is a great brand but this cleanser harm my face. I got a lot of pimples using it.

228,11646,2021-02-01,,"cleans the skin well but leaves it moisty, the fragrance is more like rotting oranges than pineapple haha but it's somehow not bad so no complains.
please press LIKE if my comment helped you :)"
229,11646,2019-08-28,I Like It,"I have an oily t zone and a dry face, an ex acne survivor

466,11646,2017-09-10,alba botanicals cleanser,lovely cleanser which doesn't dry the skin 
467,11646,2021-01-26,My face feels dry after using this one. Maybe not suitable for dry skin ,Will not buy again
468,11646,2021-01-25,No good,No good
469,11646,2024-01-13,Things will slip out every day,"There is nothing wrong with the product itself, but just wait and see if you can accept it. But it is really easy to leak. Even if it is stuck with a piece of tape, it will leak into boxes. It is all its liquid, so you need to be careful now."
470,11646,2024-09-07,My face is trembling,"
My face feels smooth and the scent is nice. However, I don't feel like it removes a lot of dead skin cells. It doesn't foam either, so I don't think it's suitable for use as a cleanser. It's just right for use as an enzyme after cleansing."
471,11646,2024-09-02,It becomes smooth!,"I bought this because I was concerned about the dark spots and roughness in my pores. It doesn't lather much, so I wet my face and lightly apply one pump and rub it in. Since I started using it every morning, the roughness on my nose and chin has almost disappeared! I also feel like the dark spots have gotten a little better! It's easy to use and doesn't leave my skin feeling too refreshing or dry after washing!"
472,11646,2024-06-27,In pores,"I bought this because I wanted it to work on my pores. It may not be good, but I use it every morning and night. I have blackheads, so I use it this often to see results quickly, and so far it's fine. However, when I applied it to my face in the bath and left it for a while after rubbing it around, my face turned red. Luckily it got better quickly, but I was surprised. People with sensitive skin should be careful. I apply one pump to my face and rubbing it around, then rubbing it around with a small amount of water to emulsify it before rinsing it off. The noticeable blackheads on my nose have improved, but I'm still concerned about my chin, and I'm looking forward to seeing the pores on my nose and cheeks. I like the scent."
473,11646,2024-06-26,amazing!!,"Since I changed the way I wash my face, blackheads have become more noticeable, so I bought this. My face became smooth the moment I used it!!! My nose, which had been rough, became smooth too... The area under my nose is the only part that is sensitive, so it got red after using this product, but even with that in mind, I'm impressed with the quality at this price. I'll use it again when I have problems with it♪♪"
474,11646,2024-05-18,,"I bought this for a family member who was concerned about blackheads and dead skin on their nose. No matter what face wash I used, my nose has never been this clean. It's now so smooth! I don't use it often, but only when I notice something bothers me, so I still have plenty left. It also works great on rough skin on the body."
475,11646,2024-03-18,Great,"This product is a real discovery for me! I bought it on the recommendation of friends, and I have not regretted it for a minute. At first I was impressed by the quality of the product - every detail is made very well. I am very happy with the formulation and ingredients used in this product - they are really top quality. The brand behind this product has proven its reputation for years, which gives me confidence in its reliability and effectiveness."
476,11646,2024-03-09,,"Rather than a cleanser, I mix it with water and use it as a face wash. When used on areas with thickened dead skin, it thoroughly removes dead skin and prevents rough skin. It's a pineapple enzyme, but I think it's easier to use than other products, so it's easier to use."
477,11646,2024-03-06,I experienced that my skin was noticeably clearer and softer. ,"My skin felt noticeably clearer and softer. I was impressed by the fact that the product's pineapple enzyme ingredient effectively removes impurities in pores and that it is gentle enough for daily use. The 237ml capacity is economical for the price, and the refreshing pineapple scent makes you feel good every time you use it."
478,11646,2024-02-01,I liked the cleansing gel!,"Gel cleanser with enzymes. It foams normally, but the consumption is not very economical. Light citrus-fruity scent, bright, convenient and high-quality bottle with dispenser. I have thin, dry skin (over 50 years old), according to my impressions, this gel is very gentle, gently cleanses, but the skin becomes very smooth. This gel is not suitable for removing makeup. "
479,11646,2024-01-03,delicious aroma,"I had been wanting to buy these products for a long time, and now that I received them, perfectly packaged and on time, I opened them and started using them immediately. The benefits apart from a delicious aroma are that they help eliminate stains and whiten the skin. The ingredients it has are a guarantee of excellent results, its size is good, I think it will last a long time. I have sensitive skin, but it has worked wonders for me, it leaves my skin super clean"
480,11646,2023-11-25,It's my favorite,"I love how gentle it is to use, and I keep using it as a makeup cleanser. The gel blends in with makeup and removes without foaming. When I have heavy eye makeup, I remove it with a remover before using it. I like how moist and refreshing it feels after washing."
481,11646,2023-11-05,Your skin will become smooth!,"This is my second purchase since the reviews are good. Even though I have sensitive skin, it doesn't irritate my skin, and I no longer have to worry about the bumps on my nostrils. I apply the gel directly and let it absorb gently, then wash it off with water. It feels a little dry, so I keep it moisturized. I love the sweet scent of tropical fruits. Recommended for those who are concerned about dark spots on the nose!"
482,11646,2024-09-13,,"I have sensitive skin, so when my skin is rough it stings a bit. Also, if it gets in my eyes it hurts (lol). These are the two things that bother me about how it feels to use, but it's nice that it cleanses thoroughly without drying out my skin. After washing, my skin feels a bit brighter and more radiant."
483,11646,2024-06-17,Repeater,"I've tried a few different ones to see if there are any better ones, but I keep coming back to this one because I get the most breakouts from washing my face. However, it doesn't foam up, so I use it in the morning and when I do my double cleansing. It would be better if the foam rinsed off easily after washing, but I use it because it's gentle on my skin."
484,11646,2024-05-26,Sensitive Skin,"It was a little too harsh for me to use as a face wash. It didn't sting, but it did dry out my skin and I got redness right after washing my face, so I stopped using it on my face and used it on my body instead. I used it over the summer hoping it would help with dullness on my neck, décolleté, elbows, knees, etc., and it felt silky smooth to the touch. The scent and lather are great, and it's not sticky, so it feels good to wash with, so I think I'll buy it again for the summer."
485,11646,2024-03-09,great,"It has a nice exotic fruity scent and the pump-type container is convenient to use. The price is also very reasonable. It says to use it by lathering with your hands, but it doesn't foam well on your hands. The cleansing power is good, but it's a bit slippery even after washing, so I'm a little confused as to whether it's properly washed. "
486,11646,2023-12-27,Effective for dark spots on the nose!,"I use it when I wash my face in the morning. Apply 2 pumps without getting your face wet. You can gently blend it in with a sufficient amount. It has a great effect on blackheads on the nose. I can't remove the white square plug, but this is good. I hope that the amount of white square plugs will decrease as I use them. It has a tropical scent, but once you rinse it off, the scent doesn't remain."
487,11646,2024-10-17,For pore care,"I use it to treat pores, especially on my nose. It has a thick texture, and I massage my nose with it after cleansing. It's gentle to the touch and doesn't leave my skin tight even after rinsing. The enzymes make it feel fresh."
488,11646,2024-09-20,Package purchase,"I use it as a cleanser, and it's gentle on sensitive skin. It's made with natural ingredients, so it's safe to use, and the size is just right. It's just so cute."
489,11646,2024-09-14,,"The detergent is perfect. Perfectly cleanses the skin, does not overdry. It has a very pleasant aroma and the dispenser allows you to use the product economically. I will order again "
490,11646,2024-09-12,Cleansing and moisturizing,"Excellent quality and size Smells great Packaging is easy to use Gentle formula for sensitive skin Benefits Cleanses and moisturizes the skin Great ingredients Pineapple is great for dark spots, acne scars and hyperpigmentation. It evens out skin tone while reducing signs of premature aging"
491,11646,2024-08-24,,"Excellent product quality, good composition, excellent capsule size, easy to swallow, good dosage, benefits for the whole body, has a positive effect on the skin, convenient packaging. I recommend"

You don’t even need to apply cream after it, it doesn’t tighten your face❤️"
494,11646,2024-07-29,,"A great washing product for the summer. I apply it in the morning, alternating with another product in the evening. Great for combination skin types, exfoliates well and does not dry out. "
495,11646,2024-07-08,Good washing gel ,"Does not dry the skin and cleans well. Sufficient for a long time. Overall I liked it. Convenient dispenser, one press is enough for me. "
496,11646,2024-06-28,It clears your pores!,"It was refreshing to use, and had a gentle finish that even my sensitive skin could feel moisturizing. The size was generous, and the quality was impeccable."
497,11646,2024-06-14,gentle,"It cleans very well without drying the skin, I use it in the morning in the shower and it leaves the skin clean without a cardboard effect or tightness on the skin after use. I have sensitive skin and it is very kind to delicate skin."
498,11646,2024-05-21,Works well,I recommend to buy! The quality is excellent The ingredients are well selected For different ages The improvement will definitely be The size is average The benefits will be The packaging is high quality
499,11646,2024-05-13,Eliminates blackheads on the nose,"It has a nice scent, and the enzymes have removed the dark spots on my pores. My daughter, a student who is prone to acne, also liked it."
500,11646,2024-05-04,,"The use is convenient, the quality is at a height, the size is convenient, the packaging is good, the advantage is noticeable, the composition is good"
501,11646,2024-04-26,,"This cleanser is gentle on sensitive skin. It is high quality as it can be used for both cleansing and washing your face. It has a pineapple scent, but it has a bit of a strong smell."
502,11646,2024-04-10,wow,"A pleasant, not dominant smell. Frequency of daily use for facial cleansing. The size lasts for two months. Gives full moisture to the face. He personally made a change in my face in terms of redness and wounds. Just remove them"
503,11646,2024-03-04,For nasal plugs,"I bought this because I wanted to remove blackheads from my nose. As a result, I think the stimulation is stronger because it dissolves. I haven't tried using it all over my nose yet because it leaves my nose red. People with sensitive skin should be careful."
504,11646,2024-02-29,,"This is an excellent product that does not feel sticky after washing and can be used for gentle daily exfoliation care. I have thin skin, so if it's sensitive, I first treat it with oil or emulsion and then use it gently with lukewarm water."
505,11646,2024-02-18,facial cleansing,"I bought it for my mother, an elderly woman, she really likes it, both the smell and the use, high quality, sufficient size, for all ages, beautiful and convenient packaging, pleasant texture, good facial cleanser, gentle, fresh feeling. "
506,11646,2024-02-14,Excellent!,"I really liked the product, the smell is incredibly pleasant, gentle. It foams well, is economical, a small pea is enough for one wash. The composition is as natural as possible, without parabens and sls. My favorite"
507,11646,2024-01-25,,"Good good! ! ! If you take your time and massage slowly, it will be effective! It's a bit stinging, but it's exciting and I like it! ! !"
508,11646,2023-12-13,good!,"I only wash my nose and chin with this. Tropical scent. It's unscented, but it smells good. It always arrives with a little leakage."
509,11646,2023-12-01,,My favorite cleanser for years. I leave it on and come back to it. It cleanses without drying my face and my skin is combination
510,11646,2023-11-01,Great,"A soft, gentle cleanser that does not dry out the face at all, but rinses well. The smell is pleasant, but it may not be enough for problem skin."
511,11646,2024-10-08,reindeer,"Other people have written that it causes redness, but I have the same skin type, and the area where I applied it turned bright red. I washed it off relatively quickly. However, when I looked in the mirror, my nose was shiny. It turned bright red (it didn't hurt or anything), but it was a strange feeling to use."
512,11646,2024-09-21,Refreshing,"It's not bad to use, but since it removes sebum-filled keratin plugs, I have combination skin, so I have to moisturize immediately after washing my face, otherwise I feel dryness. I use it after cleansing oil, or when washing my face in the morning. The tropical scent may be a matter of preference, but I didn't feel like the scent lingered while I was washing."
513,11646,2024-07-22,Not enough to remove oil,"I have oily skin, and I feel like it’s not very clean after just one wash. I still feel a bit oily on my skin, but it’s better after washing it a second time. It also stings a little after washing, which may be due to the stimulation of pineapple enzymes, but the smell is quite comfortable. Yes, it doesn’t feel tight after washing."
514,11646,2024-10-01,,"Nice and good, I didn't use it much, the first time I try it, good size, quality, I was told it's good, use it once or twice a week"
515,11646,2024-05-07,Just a super cleanser,"For my taste in use it is super! quality and size, packaging everything is fine. There are benefits for any age, hydration. Very gentle for sensitive skin. Good composition. Any frequency of use! I use it twice a day. I highly recommend trying it! I will buy more."
516,11646,2024-02-28,,"For countering blackheads in pores. I have sensitive skin, so I only use it once or twice a week, but it does make my skin a whole lot brighter. No particular irritation to the skin"
517,11646,2024-01-28,Nice,"Pleasant to use, a feeling of cleanliness remains on the face. I usually prefer using organic products, but this is a good company, the size is comfortable and the packaging is beautiful."
518,11646,2023-11-28,Recommended facial cleansing products,"The taste is slightly fruity, and the ingredients are natural. You don’t need to use too much to make it foam, and your skin feels smooth and moisturized after use. The quality is pretty good, but the pump in the packaging doesn’t seem to work very well."
519,11646,2023-11-02,It smells so good!,"The good smell will soothe you in the morning! It's comfortable to use and gentle on my skin, so even I, who have sensitive skin, found it useful as it didn't irritate my skin. I think it also has moisturizing properties!"
520,11646,2023-11-02,Natural and clean,"Appreciate that it is cruelty-free, vegan, has no artificial colors, preservatives, etc., and contains mango pear and papaya extracts. It already feels so clean and refreshing."
521,11646,2024-07-11,Face soup,"Wonderful smell, use every night, very high quality, relatively large size and worth the price, convenient packaging, very gentle to the skin, noticeable moisture"
522,11646,2023-10-26,pineapple scent,The scent of pineapple reminds me of Hawaii and lifts my mood. It's also great for removing makeup.
523,11646,2023-09-22,Clears blackheads from pores,"It is a gel-like face wash. After removing my makeup, I use it mainly on my T-zone. If you move the pads of your fingers in a vibrating motion without lathering, the pores on your nose will be cleansed. If you use this on other areas as well, it will remove dead skin cells and improve the penetration of serums, etc. The scent is fruity pineapple, which I like. The texture is more like a light gel with a thick texture rather than slimy."
524,11646,2023-09-12,,"An excellent gel for washing, ideal for normal and combination skin, the foam gently but thoroughly cleanses the skin and does not dry it out at all. Evens out the complexion, with constant use “polishes” the skin, does not dry out, and there is no feeling of tightness. But it may not be suitable for dry or dehydrated skin; it contains no oily fractions. An ideal gel for morning cleansing."
525,11646,2023-09-02,Perfect for preventing pimples and blackheads!,"When I was looking for a gel-type cleanser for the first time because I was worried about my strawberry nose, I came across this product. The texture is quite light rather than slimy, but it surprisingly cleans the pores. Be careful not to rub it too much or use it too much, but you won't be able to let it go."
526,11646,2023-07-09,,"I use it to wash my shiny face with oil in the morning. The pores are gone and the texture is smooth! will be Impressed! ! So repeat is confirmed. However, I do not recommend it to those who are looking for scents in care products because it has a strong, toned smell that is several times the enzyme-like smell of sk2. I think you'll know if you like it or not."
527,11646,2023-06-14,Wonderful!!!,"A unique facial wash with an exfoliating effect. With this tool, you can wash your skin daily and then the pores of the face will not have time to become clogged, or you can do peeling once, say, in 10 days. Due to the enzymes of papaya, the pores open and dried impurities are easily washed out. Once I had an enzymatic peeling and I really liked to cleanse the skin with it, and I found this cleanser by its composition and I am very pleased with it."
528,11646,2023-06-02,Smooth skin♪,"It's called a cleanser, but it's more like a special face wash for exfoliating dead skin cells. Soak in after removing makeup. With 2 pushes, you can wash even the decollete. It doesn't foam much, so I apply it all over my face with wet hands and then rinse it off with warm water. I use it 2-3 times a week. I love how it makes my skin feel smooth. The scent is a good scent, like a strong pineapple acidity."
529,11646,2023-01-06,,"I use it at a pace of about once a week. It may be stronger than Japanese products, but if you use it for too long, you will feel a tingling sensation. It feels just right to apply it quickly without rubbing it too carefully, let it blend in and then rinse it off. Instead, it will look very clean. The scent is pineapple with a strong acidity, a perfectly acceptable scent."
530,11646,2024-06-11,perfect,"Perfect smell, use for the facial skin, high-quality levels, light and pleasant texture, moisture for the facial skin after use, very gentle"
531,11646,2024-06-19,,"A nice product in a good size. The smell is really good. There are some that I liked better, so I will not buy it again "
532,11646,2024-01-17,,It smells like pineapple. It has a refreshing cleansing feel. It foams up quite a bit with just one push. I also love that it's cruelty-free and plant-based.
533,11646,2023-10-08,,"For a long time I wanted to try a detergent based on enzymes. I liked the composition. The packaging is convenient with a dispenser - it's great! I hope it will be spent economically. I have a sensitive skin type, enzymes will definitely suit me. But after any wash, the skin must be moisturized. If you like it, I will repeat it regularly! I am updating the review: the product is super delicate and comfortable. Refreshes the skin well, does not overdry it, brightens it a little. Ideal for morning washing. Does not foam. Does not remove makeup. I advise you to take a closer look!"
534,11646,2023-09-19,,"This tool is just a discovery for me. I bought it when I was looking for a detergent with enzymes. It has a light citrus aroma, after use it does not dry the skin at all, the face has a radiant appearance. In the summer, for me, it was a super product for washing in the morning. A very decent product for its price."
535,11646,2023-08-20,,"Late 40's. I like enzyme facial cleansing and use it not only on my face but also on my whole body. The face may become red in thin or weak areas of the skin, but it will heal with time. It might be better to change the time from painting to flushing depending on the location. Use after showering on areas where you feel rough, such as the neck, décolleté, bust, back, buttocks, and back of the thighs. Then wash with body soap. After exfoliating, the skin becomes dry, so moisturizing is essential. Cospa is good because it spreads well."
536,11646,2023-08-04,,"I bought it because I was worried about clogged pores. I use it as a daily makeup remover. Since it is a soap-removing cosmetic, it seems that there is no residue after washing. I feel that the roughness of my skin has been removed after one use. Pores are getting smaller too! I also use peeling and retinol, so this may not be the only effect, but since I started using this, I have a clearer feeling."
537,11646,2023-07-23,Moist and smooth,"The scent is pineapple itself! It smells delicious. I bought this because I wanted to do something about the square plugs around my nose. After softening the pores with a steaming towel, I applied it around my nose, massaged it lightly, and washed it off with lukewarm water. It's smooth. I couldn't get rid of the keratin plugs in one go, but it's been 3 days since I used it every day, and it seems that the keratin plugs are getting smaller and less! However, when I checked this morning, the skin on my nostrils was peeling thinly, so it seems necessary to be careful not to use too much. (Additional note) I applied it to the rough part near the shoulder blade that was hard to wash, left it for about 1 minute, and then rinsed it off to make it smooth. I still have black square plugs on my nostrils, but I'm glad that the whitish ones seem to have disappeared! As you continue, the black square plugs will also become smaller."
538,11646,2023-07-22,,"I use it to wash my face in the morning. There is no need to lather it, it is absorbed quickly, and the stickiness can be washed away pretty quickly. The pineapple scent is soothing, and I feel like my skin has become clearer, so I will definitely use it again."
539,11646,2023-07-15,,"Please, give me a like, girls. The scent is light, does not disturb, easy to use, 2 or 3 times a day, does not dry out, the quality is excellent, the size is large, enough for two months. 3 The package is cute and sweet. A light, once heavy formula, my skin is sensitive, its fit is gentle, and it is highly moisturizing"
540,11646,2023-05-24,,"I bought this after reading your reviews, and found that it cleanses the pores and leaves the skin smooth and soft. I couldn't feel the effect so far with the Japanese enzyme face wash, so I will repeat this from now on. However, since the effect is strong, if you use it every day, it will irritate you a little, so I use it about once every 2-3 days."
541,11646,2023-04-13,,"I was really surprised. No more pore plugs. So far, it's the power of enzyme face wash and various packs. It's comfortable to use, and I like the scent, which has a gentle tropical scent like pineapple. My husband, who has sensitive skin, said it would sting if he didn't wash it off right away, but he seems to recognize the quality because he uses it regularly. Gently cleansing behind the ears eliminates the oily smell, so I would recommend it to men as well."
542,11646,2023-03-03,,"I was looking for an enzyme cleanser and bought this product because it was the cheapest. Papain enzyme would be nice, but pineapple enzyme seems to be okay at this price. However, it seems to have less cleansing power than the papain enzyme face wash in powder form. Except for summer, it is ok to use in winter or changing seasons."
543,11646,2023-03-01,,"This is the first time I've purchased an enzyme face wash, so I don't know if it's because of this product, but it clearly removes dirt from my pores. Whenever I look in the mirror after washing, I always feel like I still have some left over on my nostrils, but it's definitely gone. The skin on the tip of my nose peeled off a little the first two times, so it may be too strong, so I'd like to continue using it with a little time in between."
544,11646,2023-02-16,,"I thought it was for pore care and tried it. I can't say that the blackheads on my nose are completely gone, but they are much less noticeable. It seems to have a strong cleansing power, so I use it once or twice a week. The scent is nice and tropical."
545,11646,2022-12-14,,"Like everyone else's reviews, the enzyme face wash with powder seems to be troublesome and it seems that the water is going to be messy, so it's too sloppy and I can't keep going... In that regard, this is in gel form. It seems that you can use it as it is or lather it, and it was effective for the horn plug of the nose. From now on, I want to keep using this enzyme face wash."
546,11646,2022-11-10,,"After the first use, I immediately fell in love 🥰 Cleans the skin perfectly, right up to the squeak and the skin becomes smoother. After application, be sure to moisturize the skin, as it tightens the skin. Delicate tropical scent. The packaging is convenient, and the sufficiency is large and roomy. Recommended for those with oily or combination skin."
547,11646,2022-11-03,,"I bought this because I get pimples easily and worry about pores on my nose. I like the sweet scent and look forward to using it every day. It's easy to foam and the pump makes it very convenient to use in the bathroom. It feels light and foamy, so it's not a thick foam, but it's easy to wash and has a nice feel. It feels smooth after washing, but I like it because it doesn't make me feel tight."
548,11646,2022-10-30,,"This Facial Cleanser from Alba Botanica is an excellent facial cleanser for people with sensitive skin. I've tried many face washes over the years, and this is by far the most gentle and effective I've found. It does a great job of removing makeup and impurities without stripping the skin of its natural oils. My skin feels clean and fresh after using it, and I don't have to worry about any irritation or redness it might cause. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective facial cleanser."
549,11646,2022-10-25,,"The cleanser has a gel-like feel and lathers very little. It has a fruity scent like pineapple, and when you massage it around the nostrils and wash it off, it becomes smooth and smooth. After that, I use a scrub face wash, but it's nice because it doesn't stretch."

571,11646,2024-06-07,too strong,"I have sensitive skin. I tried using it in the morning and at night and it stung my skin and made my face red. I think it's better to use it once or twice a week, not for a few minutes, but just let it soak in and wash it off immediately. People with sensitive skin should be careful."
572,11646,2024-05-19,It's doubled in price though,"The price has doubled due to the weak yen, but it removes all makeup except mascara! It may not be suitable for heavy makeup."

595,11646,2023-10-28,Smooth,"Easy to wash. I also use a powdered enzyme face wash, but this is easier. After washing, it is smooth and satisfying."
596,11646,2023-08-14,Even combination skin can be used!,"I love many of Alba's products, so I gave this cleanser a try. In my case, I have combination skin, so I choose facial cleansers based on the criteria for my weak areas, but I wanted to quickly cleanse my face on summer mornings, so I focused on washing my nose and the area around it. I chose this product as I was worried that the pineapple enzyme might be too strong, but surprisingly, it didn't cause any unpleasant irritation, and I was able to wash my forehead and chin. The bottle is tall and has a large capacity, so I think it would be convenient if there were family members with similar skin types."
597,11646,2022-08-02,,"After reading other reviews, I decided to give it a try and bought it. No, it's amazing. You can really get rid of the clogged corner plugs on the nostrils. Surprise! I've tried all sorts of cleansers like this and never had this kind of surprise. I tried massaging it with my nostrils as it was without lathering. After use, it is moist without feeling tight. It feels good to have a lotion in it. The scent is also gentler than I expected, and it smells like sweets from my childhood. It leaked a little when it arrived, but it had a vinyl cover, so it didn't affect other products."
598,11646,2022-03-01,,"I was worried about the darkening and roughness of the pores around my nose, so I bought an enzyme-containing facial cleanser for the morning. The package has been renewed and arrived. The texture is a slightly loose gel. I whisked 2 pushes with a whipping net, but the foam was light. When I wash my face like a massage around my nose, I feel that the darkening has been alleviated even with a single use! It is also effective for a rough feeling. I would like to continue using it every morning."
599,11646,2022-02-03,,"I love this cleanser, it doesn't dry out my skin. I often make up, so an important factor in choosing such a product is the quality of the skin after removing makeup. I'm quite happy)) Plus, it dries out a little if there are any rashes, as it contains papaya extract)"
600,11646,2021-11-08,,"It smells good). I bought it for use in the morning and in the evening. The only thing ... for some reason I came without a dispenser, but for me it's not a problem). I bought it from reviews, I haven't tested it yet, but I think I'll like it)!"
601,11646,2023-10-20,Economical peeling that removes well,"It's easy to use because it removes dirt well with a small amount, and the scent is a weak fruity scent that doesn't leave a residue. It's moderately thick and easy to apply, and there's a lot in it, so I think it's economical. However, it is highly effective, so those with sensitive skin should avoid using it. It's best to apply it on the sides of your nose and forehead, then under your chin, and if you really want to, finish on your cheeks and rinse it off in a short amount of time. Even though it doesn't have any grains like a scrub, my cheeks did get red. Next time, I will use it only on my nose, forehead, and chin. The part I used became smooth. I think it will be very useful if you are careful about how often you use it, where you use it, and how long you leave it on."
602,11646,2023-09-16,,"Enzyme face wash with a pleasant scent of tropical fruits. It has a slimy feel and can be washed without worrying about friction. However, I think it is probably quite strong as an enzyme. My skin, which usually uses other enzyme face washes, immediately feels tingly and turns bright red after rinsing it off... However, I think it's just as effective, so personally, I'm totally fine with it. I would like to use it properly by adjusting the frequency of use, time and amount of time I put it on my skin."
603,11646,2023-09-09,,"I like the quality of the products of this brand because of the natural composition. But this tool is not very suitable for me. After a few weeks of use, I realized that I like the cream texture of the products more, but here the product is more like a gel and dries out my skin. I think this tool is more suitable for oily facial skin"
604,11646,2023-08-22,,"After washing my face, my skin becomes a little red, but I think it works for my pores. I apply it to my tight face in the morning, lather it with a small amount of water, and then rinse it off. The pineapple enzyme may be a strong stimulus, but it doesn't get rough."
605,11646,2023-06-26,,"It feels like a thick gel, and it doesn't lather well, so I use it like a light massage. The scent has a tropical feel, but it's not too strong and doesn't leave you feeling stiff. The blackheads in the pores have not completely disappeared, but the pores are becoming less noticeable. I use it every morning as a face wash because it doesn't remove makeup."
606,11646,2023-05-24,The blackheads will come off.,"It does remove the blackheads quite a bit, but the irritation seems to be quite strong. I plan to use it while watching the adjustment. →If you use a foaming net to create a lather, it won't cause much irritation. I use it every day and have no problems."
607,11646,2022-12-24,,"When I use it, there is nothing in particular, but after using it, when I look in the mirror after taking a bath, my face turns bright red and itches a little. It's been a while since I started using it, but it will definitely happen. Washing is normal."
608,11646,2022-12-15,Great gel!!!,"I liked it very much in use: it cleanses well, does not tighten the skin, does not dry out, the aroma is pleasant, citrus, the packaging is of high quality, the size is large, enough for a long time, for any age, good composition, more suitable for combination skin !!!"
609,11646,2022-12-15,,"Maybe it's the effect of the enzyme, but when I lather it up and wash it, it gives me a tangy feeling and it feels good. I have sensitive skin, but it doesn't irritate or dry my skin, and it's gentle to use. Since I started using it somehow, a luster that seems to emit light from the inside was born. Did my skin grow? The lotion entered well, and the effect was easy to understand for a natural feel."
610,11646,2022-12-06,,"Great cleanser, skin looks cleaner after. This company has good quality. The smell is pleasant, tropical. The consistency is not thick. The packaging is convenient with a dispenser. The composition is natural. Suitable for my sensitive dry skin."
611,11646,2022-11-05,,"A non-foaming face wash. It may be good for dry skin as it doesn't feel clean after washing. I've been using it in hopes that it would have an effect on the pores on my nose, but it doesn't seem to have any visible effect yet. It's not getting worse, so there may be some effect. If you have light makeup, this one will remove it."
612,11646,2024-10-18,Good,A gentle cleanser that does not dry out the skin. I recommend it because its ingredients are gentle.
613,11646,2024-09-13,,"Pleasant smell. Foams well. Suitable for daily use for normal and oily skin. The packaging is large, but the consumption is not economical"
614,11646,2024-07-29,Good,"A good brand, soft, delicate cleansing, and the composition is quite good, the volume will last a long time "
615,11646,2024-07-11,,"If you rub it too much your skin will get red, but if you use it occasionally it feels refreshing."
616,11646,2024-06-30,Very Good,"Tropical smell, good quality, good price compared to this product in pharmacies in Israel, large and convenient packaging"

622,11646,2022-06-05,,"The smell is okay and the quality I did not like once. The size is excellent and the packaging is comfortable to use, but unfortunately it is not suitable for the skin if it is sensitive. After reading the composition of the product, I decided what to use it for my face because it contains alcohol and perfume, so the skin will not receive any benefit from it, and with time the skin gets tired from the amount of alcohol in the product And the perfume, I left it to my body. If my comment helps you, give me a like"

634,11646,2023-08-05,It will be smooth,"After using it as a trial, my skin became smooth after washing my face. The pineapple flavor was nice too. If you don't wash it thoroughly with water, the cleanser will remain on your nostrils, so be careful."

649,11646,2023-01-23,,"I love Aruba Botanica's shampoo and conditioner, so I bought it! ! I look forward to using it! By the way, I recommend shampooing and rinsing my hair at school because it makes my hair so smooth that I always get asked where it is.)"
650,11646,2022-12-08,,Great product! Leaves the face clean and fresh with a good smell. is in daily use. Quality product of medium size. Its texture is like a slightly liquid gel. I have sensitive eyes and it did not cause an allergic reaction!
651,11646,2022-12-04,,"Excellent soap with an excellent smell, daily use, high quality, excellent size, frequency that will probably be enough for several months, many benefits, stunning texture that leaves skin soft and relaxed. Easily absorbed by the skin. Sensitive to facial skin. Prevents redness and is very moisturizing."
652,11646,2022-11-21,,"It's called a cleanser, but it's a face wash, not a cleanser. I can't say that the keratotic plugs are completely wiped out (because my face has too many keratotic plugs...), but it's pretty clean. I use it every night to wash my face."
653,11646,2022-11-20,,"It contains a lot, so I even use it on my decollete. It feels like the lumps on my neck are gone. I use it to flow into the lymph while massaging."
654,11646,2022-11-20,,"I like to use it when I get up in the morning, I like the smell, there is no box, the benefit is to clean the pores, and it is not sensitive"
655,11646,2022-11-12,Excellent!,"Great soap, not foaming, those who are familiar with these Alba products that are a bit acidic and stinging will not have a problem with it, for those who are not used to it, it can be a little strange. Pleasant cleaner, not drying."
656,11646,2024-06-06,,"I started using this enzyme product for the first time, but I actually didn't notice much of an effect. It cleans well, but I don't really feel any further effects. It would be good for people who are good at using enzyme ingredients."
657,11646,2024-01-16,I did not like,"Doesn't lather in the face and doesn't feel like it's cleaning the face. And the smell is not the best. I hardly used it, I recommend it"
658,11646,2023-10-26,Become smooth!,"It doesn't get slimy unless you wash it thoroughly. I can't do it in the bathroom in the morning, so it's best to use it while taking a bath. It is recommended to use it because it will make your skin smooth after just one use."
659,11646,2023-10-24,"It's definitely safe, but it smells like toilet cleaner.","I use the Alba Botanica series because they don't contain any harmful substances and are safe, but this facial cleanser smelled like toilet cleaner, which was very disappointing. However, this is my personal opinion, and some people may find this fragrance good."
660,11646,2023-07-08,,"It may be a little dry, but when you open it, it leaks from the base of the pump, so I feel that the slimy cleanser is very effective. It's a gel type, so it feels light and foamy without using a net.It is recommended to use it in the bath"
661,11646,2022-12-06,,"The fruity scent is quite strong. I don't use it as a cleanser, but when I use it as a face wash, it cleans my face. However, it may not be suitable for sensitive skin due to the ingredients, but I felt that it was necessary to moisturize quite firmly after washing my face."
662,11646,2022-12-04,,A gentle cleansing face wash. I did not feel that it cleans my oily skin. I expect it is suitable for dry and normal. The smell is once awesome. The scent of pineapple is refreshing. It may be excellent for teenage girls or those who do not have acne and pores and do not have skin problems.
663,11646,2022-08-30,,"I use it with my hands wet in the bath after removing my makeup. After massaging it all over, if you wet it further, it will feel a little foamy. I feel that it works better when massaged with dry hands, but I feel that it is too strong, so I use it with wet hands. Since I started using it, I feel like my skin has become a little more transparent. The blackheads on my nose haven't really gone away, but I would like to continue using it."
664,11646,2022-06-13,,"I used an enzyme facial cleanser that was individually wrapped, but it didn't show any effect. After removing the make-up, the comedone on my nose is conspicuous, I thought it was no good, but I pulled out the comedone with tweezers. After using this face wash, it has become much better, and I think that the keratin plugs have become smaller little by little. The smell is sweet and sour like pine candy, and I always think that it is tropical. It is also good that no odor remains on the skin. I will continue to use it with the aim of eradicating keratin plugs."
665,11646,2022-02-03,Good vibes! !!,"It is helpful to use it as it is or after getting your face slightly wet. I didn't feel the tingling stimulus. It feels a little slimy, but I like how it feels refreshing and smooth when washed thoroughly. It is a dish that you definitely want to repeat when it is gone."
666,11646,2022-01-25,The scent of pineapple sweets,"I used about half for the night. I like the scent of artificial pineapple. Sweet and sour and refreshing! Since it is a pump type, you can make a moco-moco foam by pushing it to the foaming net. It is refreshing after washing. I don't feel any tension. While using this, I don't care about the darkening of the pores, so I think it's quite detergency. I want to repeat in the summer."
667,11646,2021-12-11,very!,"After reading the reviews, I wondered if I could get rid of the darkening of my nose after I started working as a mask. And ... I was surprised that it didn't really turn black in a day. I've been using my whole face every day since the day it arrived, but for now it's okay for sensitive skin ^^ It was the most effective facial cleanser so far. Thanks to everyone who reviewed it!"
668,11646,2024-10-13,medium ,Reasonable smell. Use in the morning and evening. Reasonable quality. Good size liquid texture but I didn't see any change in the skin
669,11646,2024-05-31,Not good,"I didn't really like the washbasin. does not lather well, there is no feeling on the face that it has been washed"
670,11646,2024-05-21,facial cleansing,Good fragrance Good size Frequency times a week Pleasant feeling in the hair
671,11646,2024-05-19,Ok,Good smell but not suitable for facial skin that tends to dry out very dry the face and did not help with pimples
672,11646,2024-05-03,good,"I don't really need this, but it felt good to wash with. Maybe it's the power of the enzymes?"
673,11646,2024-03-24,very clean,High cleanliness! But cleaning is not easy! Maybe the portion size needs to be smaller
674,11646,2024-03-08,standard,It was comfortable to use. I like that it has natural ingredients
675,11646,2024-02-18,Cleaner ,First thing wonderful flavor high quality large size good packaging 
676,11646,2024-02-12,,"It stings quite a bit. Even though I have strong skin, this may not be suitable for people with sensitive skin."
677,11646,2024-01-19,,Maybe the cleansing level is too high and not suitable for my skin
678,11646,2023-12-20,What is the effect?,"I don't know much about the effect, but it smells nice! tropical!"
679,11646,2023-12-09,high reviews,I bought it because of everyone's high reviews. The horn plug can be removed. . . I'm looking forward to using it.
680,11646,2023-11-27,,"Good smell but very strong, foaming and pleasant on the skin but can dry the skin very much with daily use."
681,11646,2021-01-06,Cleans and smoothes pores well!,"If you apply on damp skin and do not keep it for a long time, the effect will be as light as from a wash with acids. But if you apply the gel on dry skin of the face and hold it for a little like a mask, for 5 minutes, then the skin after washing will be smooth as glossy, a little taut and somewhere from 1 hour to long reddened (photo), this is how the enzymes in the composition work, so more suitable for evening washing, so that the redness goes away by morning. By the way, products with enzymes, unlike acidic ones, can be used with sensitive skin, couperose, and even in summer! BUT (!) Applied with caution to the skin with inflammation, it can provoke an exacerbation. A very large volume, enough for a very long time as the consumption is economical. The smell is exotic, not chemical, not harsh or intrusive. If before this tool you have not used anything like that and have not tried from luxury cosmetics, then you will like it, it's worth your money :) Click please like :)"
682,11646,2020-12-02,"Not only cleanses with high quality, but also gently exfoliates","Excellent wash in the morning or for the second stage of washing in the evening. I really like the fact that it not only cleanses with high quality, but also gently exfoliates, due to the enzymes included in the composition. 🍍 Enzymes are able to destroy protein bonds between dead cells, facilitating their removal, stimulate the synthesis of new cells. It is believed that the effect of preparations with enzymes is more gentle than acid preparations, so they are suitable for any type of skin, including dry, sensitive, couperose. The consistency is a transparent gel with a light fruity odor. Foams well, but less abundantly than products based on SLS / SLES. Convenient packaging with a dispenser, the gel is consumed economically 🥭 The composition is very pleasant - only mild surfactants, organic aloe juice and vegetable glycerin, pineapple and papaya extracts, panthenol, mild vegetable preservatives. The action gently but thoroughly cleanses the skin, while not drying it at all. suitable for daily care, after washing the skin does not tighten. Evens out the complexion, over time, as it were, polishes the skin 👍"
683,11646,2023-09-25,,"Although it's too dry for my dry skin, I use it to exfoliate once every two or three days in the summer. I like the scent because it's refreshing."
684,11646,2023-09-08,,"The slim bottle, bright color, and fragrance are close to my taste, but the foam is not good enough. Even if you push 4 and use a net, it will overflow from your hands because it is not a solid foam. I wonder if there will be a repeat."
685,11646,2023-09-06,No more rough skin.,"I use it when I go to bed when my skin feels rough. It removes stiffness and roughness and makes the skin smooth. On the day you use it, it is safer to moisturize more than usual."
686,11646,2023-08-21,,"It's still not as effective as others have praised, but after washing my face, my keratin plugs may come out. Even if you intend to shorten the time, after taking a bath, your face will be red and sore, like after a sunburn."
687,11646,2023-08-01,,"Non-foaming type. It makes my skin smooth, but I feel too tight after taking a bath, so I use it about twice a week."
688,11646,2023-07-22,,"I have strong skin, but it was a little rough. I'm using it on my body now, but it's going to be slippery. I didn't find it particularly irritating when I used it. Since it's an enzyme, it's best to do a patch test."
689,11646,2023-06-11,,"Gently wash with a cleansing brush for a more refreshing look. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to stop using it. I use it according to my skin tone."
690,11646,2023-05-26,,"The moment you put it on your nose, it turns white and the square plug melts? It seems that. However, my pores didn't suddenly get smaller like other people's reviews... but maybe they will go away with continued use? ? It is a star 4 with expectations"
691,11646,2023-05-15,Good,"All in all a nice product, does the job and does not dry out the skin. Nice smell not too strong but a bit chemical. A convenient bottle to use and enough for a long time."
692,11646,2023-02-22,,"Since I have oily skin, I double cleanse, but this product is mild, so it's good to use as the first face wash. After using it consistently, it seems to dissolve the blackhead well, even if it's not deep. I think I need it separately"
693,11646,2022-11-15,,"I think it's easy to use because it's a non-foaming gel. I don't know the effect yet, but the scent is not too strong and easy to use."
694,11646,2022-07-27,Excellent!,"Favorite site. If you have ever made an order on this site, then you understand how high-quality goods are sold here. Fast delivery, quality and the ability to read product reviews / ask a question."
695,11646,2022-07-22,Excellent!,"Quality, good product. The packaging is tight and good quality. The price is budget, pleased. I will buy more on this site. I recommend to family and friends to buy."
696,11646,2022-07-22,,The quality suits me. I liked the packaging. The ingredients are acceptable. The composition is quality. The taste is very intense. The smell is awesome. The size is normal. There is a benefit. Age is not limited. Use convenient
697,11646,2022-07-22,Excellent!,The composition is perfect! The price was very surprising. It came very quickly! Excellent quality. The aroma is very pleasant. The packaging is compact and convenient.
698,11646,2022-07-15,,The quality is super. I liked the packaging. The ingredients are of high quality. The composition is quality. The taste is pleasant. The smell is good. The size is normal. The benefits have been tangible. Age is not limited. Use is good
699,11646,2024-04-20,,good facial cleanser. nice smell. good composition and reviews
700,11646,2024-01-02,,"Reasonable price, fresh taste, will buy again"
701,11646,2023-08-30,,"The scent is only the scent of pineapple and detergent, like the scent of pineapple detergent, as in the review. It was a smooth gel like milky lotion. It starts to tingle after a while after applying it to your face, and the tingling continues for a few minutes even after you wash it off. However, it didn't irritate my skin and made my skin smooth. I had an image that enzyme cleansers would dry my face, but I was surprised that this product didn't dry at all after washing it off. Although it is irritating, it does not get rough, so it seems to be usable every day."
702,11646,2023-01-29,,"The product smells beautiful in all vitamins, with excellent proportions, and its price is suitable for everyone. I highly recommend it regarding age and the rest of the details. It is necessary to read the details on the packaging. I used it, and it gave me a lot. It gives energy and refreshment. May God make you happy and fulfill your aspirations. Girls, I need likes, put me like, may God be pleased with you, make your hearts happy, and enlighten your paths"
703,11646,2022-10-01,,"It smells really good, juicy and delicious (laughs). It has a loose texture and the foam is light, but as expected, it is an enzyme that makes the skin feel refreshed. My square plugs are stubborn, so it seems like I'll have to stick with it, but it's easier to use than the individual powder type I've been using."
704,11646,2022-09-17,"The number of keratin plugs will decrease, but they will not disappear completely.","It's hard to dry, and if you use it, you'll get less square plugs. It has a tropical, juice-like scent, but it's not artificial, so it's pleasant. It doesn't leave a scent, doesn't irritate, and doesn't dry out. It doesn't make my skin look thinner, so I highly recommend it. I use it around my nose and chin as it is without lathering once or twice a week. Wash your face from above and rinse off. Otherwise, it won't come off just by rinsing gently, so you have to wash your face or rub it. The amount is quite large, a little is enough, and I think the cost performance is also good. I feel like my pores are smaller."
705,11646,2022-09-12,,"About 1.5 pumps when lathering and using. When using it as it is, I use it with one push. Even if you don't lather, if you gently rub your hands and wash it, the wash will be smooth and moist. The foaming is not so good, so I thought it would be better to use it without foaming for good cost performance. Washing up is no different. I don't think you'll notice a dramatic change in your pores right away. If you continue, it feels like the dirt in the pores is falling and it's getting a little smaller."
706,11646,2022-09-04,,"My skin is mixed and it suits me very well, God willing. He made many comments about the improvement of my skin from the day I started using it. One thing is considered a defect for me, but I noticed that I need to use a foaming lotion once a week. I mean, at the end of the week I feel light deposits on my skin that needs a stronger cleaning than this lotion, other than It is excellent and I recommend it"
707,11646,2022-08-22,Gel type leaves a moist feeling,"It is a gel type with a slightly cloudy and refreshing citrus scent. It feels a little slimy while washing, but after washing, it does not remove too much sebum and leaves a moist feeling. It washes just right for my slightly dry skin. The scent is not too strong and is very useful."
708,11646,2022-08-07,Slippery,"It doesn't tingle, and the blackheads in the pores are refreshing! The scent is tropical and I love it. The packaging is cute too. I have sensitive skin and it was fine. The pump is also easy to use. It's a transparent gel type, but when you add water, it foams a little."
709,11646,2022-06-30,,"If you notice it from adolescence, it's a strawberry nose. My mother also had a wonderful strawberry nose, and I was always worried about hereditary persistent keratin plugs. When I was young, I used to do a lot of nose packs. The next day after using this, when I looked in the mirror at the time of makeup, the pores in my nose were open. The keratin plugs disappeared and the pores remained open. It's often stunning that there are no tweezers that can be pulled out so easily. If you put it on your face and twirl it, your skin will turn red and you will feel irritation, so I think it is strong in terms of ingredients. But I will use it. It is not suitable for washing your face and it feels like dirt remains, so if you wash it off with a face wash foam without washing it after massaging it, it will become slippery and the keratin plug will melt. Cospa is very good because it is effective with a small amount."
710,11646,2022-06-19,,"I am worried about the dirt on my pores and the stiffness of my skin, so I use an enzyme facial cleanser. After washing, it was moisturized, and my skin became shiny and I didn't mind the dirt on my pores. It is a pump type and the size is just right."
711,11646,2022-06-01,,"I started using it because I was worried about pores. It's sensitive skin, but it's not a problem, and it's very easy to use because you don't need to whip powder. The gentle pineapple scent is also fun. It's perfect for the coming season. In the morning, lightly twirl your nose and forehead with one push. 2-3 pushes after cleansing at night. I use it as it is without foaming. It is also recommended to use it on sticky places such as the back ~ It has become smooth. It seems that the essential pores have become a little cleaner. I liked it, so I made an additional order before it disappeared, but the lid was loose and the cardboard and other products arrived in a terrible state 😭 There is also such a thing 💦💦, but immediately after inquiring I got a refund."
712,11646,2022-05-26,,"Buy it already the third people soap that makes lipeng for the face but can also drop your skin a bit red if you leave the soap on the face for too long, nevertheless it cleans really well and feels the later cleansing of the face a soap that is also good for oily skin"
713,11646,2022-05-09,,"The amount used each time is just one click. I started shopping in March, and the whole family has not used up until May 9th of any age. After washing the face, the skin feels smooth and moisturizing, not sensitive, has a little pineapple smell, and the ingredients are natural."
714,11646,2022-04-02,,"I used to use powdered enzyme facial cleanser, but it became troublesome to open one bag at a time each time I used it, and it became troublesome to whisk, so I arrived at this place with a good evaluation! It's refreshing after washing, but it doesn't feel taut and it's easy! However, I smelled a little subtle."
715,11646,2022-03-10,,"A proven purchase, I take it not for the first time, the design of the bottle and the composition have changed a little, now it doesn’t foam so much, I would say at all, for those who are not used to it, they probably won’t like it, but those who used it before will appreciate it."
716,11646,2022-01-30,,"I took it out of curiosity and am very satisfied. It can also be used as a gel for washing, it can also be used as a mask for several minutes on the skin of the face to hold and rinse. The skin is clean right up to the squeak.🔥"
717,11646,2022-01-28,A slight pineapple scent!,"Although it is a gel cleanser, you can make a firm foam other than using a foaming net. (You can do it well with a little water on the net.) It was refreshing when I washed it while being healed by the scent of pineapple, but it didn't feel dry immediately. The black head of the nose is getting better. Using it twice a day in the morning and evening seems to be a little irritating, so after using a makeup remover every one or two days, I'm doing double cleansing with this."
718,11646,2022-01-17,,"I thought that it would smell like something tropical, but in reality the citrus aroma is very pleasant. The bottle leaked. It's good that it was wrapped in mica, otherwise the whole box would be in this gel. The skin of the face washes chic, but immediately after use, I want to apply serum and cream to the skin, as it begins to dry."
719,11646,2021-12-31,,"There is little foaming even when using the net. As you can see in the review, if you apply the undiluted solution around the nose and chin and massage it, the pores will not be noticeable if you repeat it every other day, although it cannot be removed once. The darkening will gradually disappear. If you have dry skin, maybe every 3 days is better?"
720,11646,2022-01-20,Satisfactorily,"It dries the skin a little, but it's not critical. The smell is strong chemical and rich. It doesn't lather much, but it cleans well."
721,11646,2023-05-17,,"Unfortunately, it has a strong fragrance, and my skin became irritated because of it, and it became red, as if it was burnt. Note that my skin is basically sensitive. I mean, people whose skin is sensitive like me. I advise you to be careful of it, because it irritates honestly 💔"
722,11646,2023-11-14,High cleanliness,"Fresh smell, high cleanliness but dry"
723,11646,2022-04-02,,"alba BOTANICA This is my first purchase. The package has changed! Immediately after opening it, I tried it on the back of my hand, but I was surprised that it became slippery. I'm looking forward to washing my face! !! When the product arrived, a little liquid leaked from the base of the pump head, so I thought that if I put it in a plastic bag or something, the inside of the cardboard would not get dirty."
724,11646,2021-03-20,Natural and organic ingredients are also very cute,"The surface activity of this product is glucoside and betaine, which is quite mild in nature and can be used with peace of mind for sensitive muscles. Transparent gel texture, rich tropical fruit flavor, not much foam, but the cleansing effect is not bad, papaya enzyme really dissolves a part of dead skin and cutin, the skin is slippery after washing, and it feels moisturized and comfortable."
725,11646,2023-09-06,,"Slimy. Dirt in pores is hard to remove. It smells like pineapple. It's okay if you don't like it. If I rub my cheeks too much, it will irritate my skin, so I only use it partially."
726,11646,2023-08-30,,"The supplements are just wonderful. The size of the tablets are comfortable to swallow. As for the result, I can’t say for sure, since I started drinking quite recently. A wonderful shampoo. After it, the hair becomes just silky. The packaging was great."
727,11646,2023-07-16,,"It has a very strong pineapple smell, and the texture is relatively thin, like water, and the skin does not feel very dry after use."
728,11646,2023-07-09,,"I use it once or twice a week for pore control. I like how the rough surface becomes smooth. However, I only use it on my T-zone and chin because my cheeks become red and irritated for a while after using it, probably because of the strong stimulation."
729,11646,2023-06-29,There is no refreshing feeling of enzyme face wash,It's a slimy liquid that feels moisturizing even after washing your face. The image may be different for those who want a refreshing feeling after enzyme cleansing.
730,11646,2023-04-22,,"I bought it for the first time, but I didn't like the scent. I don't have sensitive skin, but it made my skin tingle a little, so it didn't suit me."
731,11646,2023-04-15,,I like it because it smells fresh. The quality is good. Configuration is convenient. It feels soft and moist after washing. It is good for simple cleansing.
732,11646,2023-03-18,,"Purchased with expectation for pineapple enzyme. I didn't feel any particular change after using it once, but it didn't irritate my skin, and the bright package made me feel more excited."
733,11646,2022-11-27,Ok,"I liked the product in terms of quality, but the consistency is watery, and when you press the dispenser, it “spits”. Obviously, packaging is not suitable for this consistency."
734,11646,2022-11-08,,"Reasonable soap I didn't fly on. Such a sweet fruity scent. The packaging is very large and the value for the price is good, but I won't order Shaev"
735,11646,2022-10-17,,"It seems that cleansing can also be done, but I mainly use it in the morning to wash my face. It was too strong for me, who has sensitive skin. So, I only use it on my nose and dilute it with water to wash it all over. Then you can use it without discomfort. Regarding lathering, even if you use a net, it is soft and does not lather much. As everyone says, the nostrils are less clogged! When I took a picture at the salon I went to, I was surprised to see that my sebum had visibly decreased since I started using it compared to last time."
736,11646,2022-09-26,,"Originally I only used papain (papaya) enzyme, but the price is too high and the price is cheap, so I bought this product advertised as “enzyme”. I wondered if the pineapple enzyme would be okay, and it took me a while not to know what the concentration was, but it was harsh at the low price. I cleanse with Baja 2% at night and use an enzyme cleanser in the morning. I've seen a lot of reviews saying it's slippery, but I wonder if it's because the enzyme dissolves the oil and dead skin cells on the skin's surface. Because when I used the powdered papain enzyme I used before, I felt that kind of slippery. However, this cleanser is more slippery than papain powder. However, it doesn't feel like the sebum is not being wiped off, and there is a sense of irritation. The smell is… . It seems sweet at first, but when you rub it on your skin, it smells like fermented fruits such as pineapple..^^"

Since it is gel-like, if you wash it off with hot water after massage, you will feel that your one-tone face will become brighter. When I washed only the back of my left hand, I could clearly see the difference in skin tone from the back of my right hand, which was not washed. It seems that it can be used as a small gift for those who like HAWAII."
747,11646,2022-01-28,,"It's very easy to use, not sensitive at all. The pores were very large before, but after using it, it clearly felt clean, the pores began to shrink, and the acne was also reduced a lot. It is very recommended."

However, my skin is in good condition, and I can just wash my face in the bathroom. This Alba brand is an organic brand that is also available at Whole Foods in Hawaii, so you can buy it cheaper than in Hawaii."

A glass of a washbasin cannot cost under a thousand rubles - the declared surfactants (even soft and natural ones) plus enzymes and fruit acids are not in that concentration to cost so much. In addition, the product photo shows a beautiful, matching bottle, dispenser. But in reality it was just an ordinary cover, which is inconvenient to use. I had to look for something at home from stocks. From the pros: the skin after this remedy becomes as if sliding, any cream fits well on it. And the Hawaiian washbasin WITHOUT FOAM, if this moment is important for someone. Although the result is not affected by the presence of foam or not, it washes and moisturizes really well. As an experiment, the Hawaiian cleanser was interesting, but because of the price, I would prefer to go back to Korean washbasins anyway."

Even though I knew it wasn't good, even if I pushed it out with my fingers, I got a red nose and there was no sharpness. Even though the thin skin can be peeled off with the nose pack, it is not as effective as I expected. The face wash has run out, so I bought this as a trial. I massaged my nose for a couple of minutes with a half-press of the pump, and all the keratin plugs disappeared ... I've been worried for nearly 30 years and what was the money I spent? I laugh. Since the keratin plug was firmly removed, the pores are dented on the contrary. Next, I think I need to buy a peeling agent. I also recommend it to children who are getting greasy."

The second time, washed him almost immediately redness was small and it was faster. Now I use the gel every day, no unpleasant reactions are no more, even if you hold it a little longer, perhaps, the skin was used.

857,11646,2023-02-27,,"Non-foaming type, refreshing after washing, but I don't know if it's washed."
858,11646,2023-02-15,,It smells good. It's subtle when it comes to clean pores.
859,11646,2023-01-31,,"The smell is quite nice, a tangy smell of pineapple. It's a basic cleanser that unfortunately dried out my skin."
860,11646,2023-01-20,,The facial cleanser is strong and suitable for oily skin. Those with dry skin may feel a slight burning sensation.
861,11646,2023-01-07,,"Refreshing and comfortable to use! The size was also good! It's a pump, so it's easy to use and I love it!"
862,11646,2023-01-06,,Very good. It cleans without drying out. Does not foam. It has a mild pineapple scent.
863,11646,2022-06-29,I like tropical scents,"I tried various things such as whipping and using it as it is, but it did not work very well for my keratin plugs, and it was a little effective if I massaged it twice in a row, but it seems to be very irritating. My face has turned red. I was not good at using it because it remained slimy even after being washed away. I like the tropical scent so much that it heals me, so I mix it when I wash my body with soap, but I feel like it's smooth and smooth, and I don't mind the slimy feeling."
864,11646,2022-05-30,,"Since it is difficult to foam, it is light foaming even if it is foamed with a foaming net. It's an enzyme, so it's refreshing, but it's still moisturized and smooth, and it doesn't get rough or dry even if you use it every day. I don't particularly feel the effect on darkening of the nose or dead skin cells, but is it acne on the back? I feel that the number of lumps has decreased."
865,11646,2022-05-10,,"I used to use a powdery enzyme facial cleanser, but I found it difficult to use, but I found this gel-like product! I bought it because everyone's reviews were good. The cute bottle and the nice scent of tropical fruits will raise your tension. I mix it with face wash and whisk it, or put it on my skin and use it like cleansing. It's refreshing, but it's also very moist and smooth. Sometimes I get a little tingling, but I use it about twice a week. It's used about twice a week, so I think it's a good deal at this price with this size."
866,11646,2022-02-01,,"This product not only has a cleansing effect, but also eliminates dryness and flaking. After using this gel, the skin becomes Moisturized, soft and silky. In addition, the feeling of freshness lasts a very long time. Suitable for Sensitive skin type... The gel foams well, rinses off easily, has a pleasant smell. In addition, it has a whitening effect, it is easy to apply with a convenient dispenser... The composition is good..."
867,11646,2022-01-01,Smooth enzyme facial cleansing,"The scent of pineapple is faint, and since it is an enzyme, you can clean the pores cleanly. I felt a little taut. There was no tingling or tingling. People with dry skin need to be well moisturized. Please note that the package is not a pump type unlike the photo."
868,11646,2021-09-24,,"I started receiving my luggage today and used it. The scent is also very refreshing and good. I imagined it smelled a little sweet, but it smelled like citrus. The feeling of use is not a foamy facial cleanser, but it is refreshing after washing. I felt a little tingling while washing, but it didn't turn red and didn't dry. I feel that the penetration rate of the lotion after washing my face was also good, so I will mainly use it at night. And for the bottle, I got it by pump. I thought that the pump type was good and some people might hesitate to buy it, so I did not know the effect yet, but I hurriedly reviewed it."
869,11646,2021-07-07,Normal !,"Nice and soft face gel. Removes eye makeup quickly. It smells good, a large package, but Expensive and came to me without a dispenser, although in the photo with it, it is not very convenient to use, because when squeezed onto the package, too much gel is poured out, it is quite liquid. Will not last long, although the natural composition and brand are good, I will not order more"
870,11646,2021-06-12,,"A good gel for washing, with a pleasant scent. When used in the form of a gel, it washes away ""to a squeak"" and, accordingly, a feeling of tightness appears. I poured it into a foaming agent, diluted it with water (every 3 times) and everything is fine - the foam is thick, the skin does not tighten, does not dry out. Powder washes away, I have not tried foundation."
871,11646,2021-04-23,Excellent!,
872,11646,2021-04-20,,It smells good ^ _ ^ It's easy to use ^ _ ^ You can wash your face cleanly and it's comfortable in the morning and evening. Pineapple Enzyme 🍍 Comfortable for refreshers. It's hard to find something that suits me in my fifties who are suffering from skin problems all year round. But this is probably good ❣️
873,11646,2021-03-12,Wonderful enzyme gel for every day !!!,"With the coming of spring, I decided to put aside my Acid Washers and switch to something softer. The choice fell on the enzyme. It is believed that the effects of enzyme preparations are more gentle than acid preparations, and that they can be used even by people with sensitive skin. Remember how the oral cavity stings when you eat pineapple (this is what enzymes work), and on the skin they kind of dissolve everything unnecessary, and over time they polish our skin. The composition of the gel pleased me: soft pea, organic aloe juice and vegetable glycerin, pineapple and papaya extracts, panthenol. Mild herbal preservatives. The gel does not contain oils, neither chemical nor vegetable, which is great for oily skin. It satisfies me completely. I also want to try to take a salicylic gel of this company for the night in order to clean out the remaining comedones. I think there will be a fire together. If the review was helpful, click like)))"
874,11646,2021-02-23,the tone of the face even evened out!,"I have been using it for about a month, I want to note that the product copes with cleansing by 100%, does not tighten the skin, is perfectly lather, does not cause allergies.

875,11646,2021-02-18,Favorite washbasin!,"One of the favorites from Alba Botanica. I bought it more than once! I have thin, sensitive skin prone to breakouts and irritations. I use the gel mainly for morning washing, it does not foam very well, but it rinses off well and quickly with water. The gel perfectly cleanses and refreshes the face, makes it smooth. Most importantly, after washing, there is no dryness, no tightness, no film. The dispenser always ""spits"". Consumption is small, sooo long enough. It smells good. From this series, I also like the mask on papaya enzymes, I also try to have it all the time. Put YES! Have a nice day and happy shopping!"
876,11646,2021-02-15,,"I use it to wash my face in the morning. When I wash my face with this, the roughness on my face disappears and my face becomes smooth, but it doesn't feel tight and feels really good. Wet your face a little, then apply 2 pumps in a gentle massage motion and rinse off. It feels really good."
877,11646,2021-02-13,Favorite wash,"My all-time favorite cleanser! Ideal for combi skin. Gently exfoliates with enzymes, improves complexion and skin structure. Wash once a day - in the evening, otherwise you can dry it out. Perfect for pre-care treatments, as it cleans deeply. The only thing, the last time came in a new package without a dispenser, not so convenient, but solved."
878,11646,2021-02-06,Excellent tool👍,"I have a fat t-zone and this tool does a great job with it. Before using, I moisten my face with warm water, lather the product in my hands and only then apply it on my face. I can't estimate how well it removes mascara from eyelashes, because I cleanse the skin in 2 stages. 1st hydrophilic oil from heimish, 2nd this foam"
879,11646,2021-02-04,Excellent!,"The word of mouth said that the scent was strong, but I didn't mind at all. It was refreshing after washing, but it didn't feel smooth, so I think it feels good to use. It lasts a long time because it foams well with a small amount."
880,11646,2021-01-22,Super For Summer,"This cleanser contains enzymes that perfectly exfoliate the skin without increasing its photosensitivity. Therefore, the washbasin is especially suitable for summer and active sun, when you want a light peeling, but you don't want to worry about possible pigmentation again. But for the autumn-winter period it is suitable as a morning cleansing due to the pleasant and unobtrusive scent of pineapple, which invigorates perfectly. Due to its large volume, it can also be used for the body. An excellent tool!"
881,11646,2021-01-07,,"A rule that I use nowadays a week or more, it smells saj pineapple 😂 I swear it is sweet, I like mixed skin and it suits it. Praise be to God. I use it in the morning or before bed before I do not lower the night care creams, its size is good and there are no harmful substances such as parabens.

884,11646,2020-10-05,For many years my constant purchase,"This washbasin was one of my first purchases on Iherb and since then it has been my constant purchase for many years and I don't even think of exchanging it for something else, it fit me so perfectly. The first few bottles, I was just happy with it as a morning cleanser for the face: it gently removes impurities, cleanses pores and does not cause dryness and flaking, as it happens on my skin with other products (my skin is combined, sensitive with signs of rosacea) ... And then I did not have time to order another bottle and I ran out of it. I had to use something else and then I felt the difference! Both dryness and flaking and clogged pores returned. Now I always keep 1-2 bottles in stock."

If you massage for a while, the skin will be tingling and you will feel that the ingredients are working. Also, it will be smooth when washed off. The price is reasonable, so I will repeat it."
887,11646,2019-12-04,Ideal,"The gel is soft, the skin does not dry. It feels like skin becomes smooth, possibly due to enzymes in the composition. The smell is awesome, does not remain on the skin. I use solo or after hydrophilic oil. If I’m eating somewhere, I use it both as a shampoo and as a wash and as a shower gel."
888,11646,2019-03-17,"45 years old, slippery.","I thought that the smell was good or bad and it was not good, but I was immersed in the bath, and I washed gently so as to gently massage with a lukewarm ... ... sooo, enzyme!

921,11646,2020-11-20,Cleansing gel with pineapple and papaya enzymes,"Get a tropical glow from the comfort of your apartment! Alba Botanica Hypoallergenic Cleansing Gel with Pineapple and Papaya Enzymes is a versatile 2-in-1 product. At first glance, it's a face wash. On closer examination, it turned out that it was a mild ""acid peeling"". ✓Mild surfactants are: Decyl glucoside, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and Cocoglucoside. ✓Pineapple extract and Bromelain (plant enzyme from pineapple) stimulate microcirculation, tighten pores ✓Papaya and hibiscus extract. Enzymes are natural exfoliating ingredients that break down dead skin cells, skin debris and impurities without damaging the natural lipid protective film of the skin. The gel is in an opaque plastic bottle with a pump dispenser. It works well, dispensing equal portions. One is just enough for me to wash my face and neck. The gel is colorless and absolutely transparent, with a homogeneous gelatinous liquid consistency. The aroma is pleasant and unusual, similar to the aroma of some kind of ""tropical fruit"" gum. It is both exotic sweet and sour. Sometimes a piece of gel freezes in the nozzle and in this case the jet can shoot rapidly and chaotically. Foaming of the gel is weak, despite the abundance of surfactants in the composition. Lather when lathering is minimal and as if creamy. Alba Botanica gel performs its main function 100%. It gently cleanses the face and neck from everyday dirt, right down to makeup. The skin after it is clean, which is especially well monitored by the cleanliness of the cotton pad with tonic, with which I wipe my face after washing. There is no feeling of dryness and tightness. I use it every other day. A mild enzyme peeling is a bonus to washing. The first time I underestimated the power of the product: I lathered my face and left it on for a few minutes. Already washing off with water, I felt a slight burning sensation on the skin. It quickly passed, literally after applying moisturizer on top. I also do not recommend combining an enzyme gel for washing with an acid peeling. Once I washed my face with a gel, and then applied the Andalou Naturals pumpkin and honey glycol mask. Another time, after the gel, I used Derma E glycolic tonic. I overdid it in short, for my skin it is too much. As a result, I paid for the amateur performance with redness and burning on the skin, but not critical. Enzyme Gel works best solo or before applying moisturizing and nourishing masks. According to my feelings, it promotes a deeper penetration of nutrients into the skin."
922,11646,2020-10-25,The best,Good enzyme cleanser. I took my daughter to a teenager with problem skin. She really likes this tool. Does not tighten the skin. Does not cause rash. Washes well with water.
923,11646,2022-09-30,,"Good product but can be a bit drying. It will not turn your face into parchment, but you want to moisturize the skin immediately after use. I prefer a gentler cleanse. I don't think it's suitable for sensitive skin."
924,11646,2022-08-21,,"It dries out every day, so I use it when I'm concerned about the roughness of my skin. It will be greatly reduced once. I only use it occasionally, but I'm worried about losing it."
925,11646,2022-07-11,,It is a gel that does not foam at all. The smell is very sweet of pineapple. Cleaning is good. And it's very natural. Two or three pumps cleanse the face. I don't think it will last long.
926,11646,2022-02-03,,"With this cleanser, your complexion will be fresh and radiant again. Pore-cleansing pineapple and skin-brightening papaya enzymes wash away impurities, makeup and dullness. Aloe, hibiscus and passionflower provide much-needed rest and recovery, soothe and restore balance. This is a real tropical brilliance."
927,11646,2022-01-09,,"After using it for a few weeks, I feel that my pores have cleared up. At first, the scent was a nice pineapple scent, but it changed a little as I used it."
928,11646,2022-01-08,Good,"No bubbles So it's not a familiar feeling, but it removes oil well, but it doesn't seem to dry out the skin, so it's good for dry weather like these days."
929,11646,2022-01-04,,"Pore-unclogging pineapple and skin-lightening papaya enzymes wash away impurities, makeup and dullness. Aloe, Hibiscus and Passionflower provide much needed rest and recovery, soothe and restore balance. This is a real tropical sheen."
930,11646,2021-11-11,,"There was nothing tingling. I don't foam, but I wash my face and neck while massaging. The scent is citrus and soothing. I think the horn plug in the nose has become loose and easy to remove. I will repeat again."
931,11646,2021-05-31,,"I take off two stars for what I wanted and selected the product not only according to its characteristics, but also with a dispenser for ease of use, it came with an ordinary cap, now you need to look for and select a dispenser somewhere, without it it is inconvenient to use even if it is good"
932,11646,2023-03-21,,"It feels very dry and does not feel moisturizing, and the skin becomes rough after use, which is not suitable for dry and sensitive skin. The portion is generous and the packaging of the pump head allows for easy access to the product."
933,11646,2023-01-09,,"Do enzymes really work? I don't understand well, and the scent is cheap, so I stopped using it. There was no itching or skin irritation."
934,11646,2022-03-22,,"I've been worried about it for a long time, but I couldn't buy it because it was out of stock, and when I was on sale, it happened that the stock was restored and I could buy it, so I bought it immediately! I think the package is a little different from the one in the photo, but it's Hawaiian and cute, and I don't know how to use it because I haven't used it yet, but it's a popular item because it's sold out a lot! Lol I'm looking forward to it!"
935,11646,2021-12-06,,"With a refreshing scent, you can refresh your skin after use. But I have atopic and dry skin, so it was a little irritating. I try to use it with foam as much as possible. I like the feeling and scent, but I try not to use it every day. If you have normal skin or oily skin, you can use it without any problem."
936,11646,2021-09-16,,"Certainly, the dirt on the pores will be removed cleanly and it will become smooth. But while I was washing, my skin became a little tingling and my skin turned red immediately after washing my face. It will settle down after a while ... You may want to refrain from using it when your skin is weak or inflamed."
937,11646,2021-09-01,,"I use it for the second stage of cleansing, after the hydrophilic oil. It does not dry the skin, cleans well, the consumption is economical, half pressing the pump is enough for the whole face. I wash it off with a konjak sponge. I hope for a long-term and gradual effect of the enzymes in the composition."
938,11646,2021-08-15,Gentle cleansing for every day,"A good wash option for every day. Gentle, helps to remove residual makeup remover. I also use this tool when you just need to wash your face. It’s unlikely to clear the pores, but I didn’t hope so. It does not dry out the skin, but after washing I always apply serums, creams, etc. I do not recommend for those who have sensitive skin with irritations, wounds and the like - it can pinch and irritate *** If my review was useful for you, click, please ""yes"" / ""yes"". Thanks to"
939,11646,2021-08-04,nice smell,"I bought it because I like the scent of this series. However, not limited to this, the enzyme-containing facial cleanser seems to be too strong for me, and I have used several types before, but none of them suits my skin. It feels good to use as a detergent to wash masks that have been soiled with makeup. The price is not so high."
940,11646,2021-07-06,,"Wonderful washroom. It cleanses well, refreshes, does not dry and does not tighten the skin at all, has a pleasant aroma. By the way, with daily use, it helps to cope with age spots. I have not yet used other products of this company, but there is already interest. I am 37, combination skin (oily + normal), prone to pigmentation, use time - summer"
941,11646,2021-06-08,It is a repeat.,"It is already the 4th one. The dullness of the skin is removed and it becomes soft. It is also good to use it with wet hands. Postscript I recently started using my daughter who learned makeup. I was worried about my dry skin, but I can use it without any irritation. I don't think it feels rough."
942,11646,2021-04-26,,"The washroom is excellent. After all the Korean foams, which do not give the feeling of the skin washed to a squeak, I suddenly wanted this for the summer. And I was not mistaken with the product. Smells fruity, runny, but you need a little. It tingles slightly (enzyme action), leave it for 20 seconds and rinse it off. My skin is oily, allergic. The washbasin was perfect."
943,11646,2021-04-24,,"A good second stage of cleansing. It cleans perfectly, but dries my skin. It should be used only in the evening and not every day, but when the skin requires increased attention) For the summer it will be better, since the skin becomes more oily + I use SPF, which must be well washed out of the pores"
944,11646,2021-02-20,,"My skin is dry and sensitive, prone to redness and outbreaks of dermatitis. The foam gently but thoroughly cleanses the skin, evens out the complexion, over time, as it were, ""polishes"" the skin. Of course, the effect is not comparable to the effect of special means - peels and masks, but nevertheless, it is. I don’t use a gel for daily care, because the composition does not contain oils that soften the effects of water and cleansing agents, but a couple of times a week for additional * polishing “it works great. For owners of oily or combination skin, it seems to me, it is quite suitable for daily use."
945,11646,2021-01-26,enzyme wash for radiance,"the cleansing gel with enzymes will not cleanse the skin until it squeaks, but will inspire with its aroma to accomplishments and lift your spirits. very nice texture. the dispenser is not very convenient, if you do not use it for two, then the gel hardens and the gel spits out. I like it. I repeat)"
946,11646,2021-01-24,Excellent!,"Great washbasin. Smells like pineapple, but not chemical. Very nice gel, easy to whip with your hands, but be careful with the pump, as sometimes the gel shoots out of the palm (The product itself cleanses the skin well, but not makeup !! I noticed that the skin became lighter and pineapple acids are doing their job very delicately. this product did not cause my sensitive skin!"
947,11646,2021-01-23,"The product is good, the smell is not very good","I have a combi skin, I took this wash for the summer and it does it perfectly. Cleans the skin until it squeaks. But because of the smell, I really wanted to finish it. For me it smells like a moldy barely perceptible fruit, maybe just had no luck with the can. If the effect is important to you and you are not susceptible to smells, then feel free to take it."
948,11646,2021-01-22,Favorite Washer of Recent Years,"I have been using this gel for washing for the last 6-7 years, bought the first times in America while traveling, and then began to order on iherb. I have normal skin, the gel washes off makeup perfectly, does not dry the skin, does not cause any irritation, etc. I don't even want to use other gels. Super!"
949,11646,2021-01-19,,"One of the best washers! I love it when the dispenser, I love it when the packaging is made of recycled plastic and then it can also be recycled - this is functional) I love it when there is no SLS in the washrooms! Here the enzymes are a light peeling, the face is very smooth after it. Foam well, pleasant smell! Everything is super great!"
950,11646,2019-10-18,"Nice soft wash, but no longer buy","The wash is very gentle, until the creak, the skin will not wash. My skin is oily, I want something more powerful. A separate minus is the dispenser. In the nose the gel solidifies with a lump, after which it begins to spit. In general, squeezing the right amount is not so easy, part is on the wall, but even when everything falls into the palm of your hand, you get an overrun. The smell is pleasant, similar to their enzyme mask. I love her dearly, but I don’t think I will repeat the wash."
951,11646,2019-10-08,Strong thing,"Cleanser - gel for washing. When I ordered, I thought it was milk, because I have dry thin skin 35+ and lately I have been buying face cleansers of this particular format. It was enough for me once to understand that this gel is a pretty strong thing. It nibbles a little, the skin immediately brightened a little, and I have something to lighten. I decided not to risk my face :) and left it for the summer, and not for every day."
952,11646,2019-05-28,I think there are individual differences,"It did not suit me of dry skin. After washing my face was dry and not moist. But the smell is very good and it is a pity that I did not fit the skin. I wanted to use ... When I gave it to my sister with mixed skin, I was surprised that the first facial wash removed the rough nose, and the skin tone also became brighter and whiter! It may be too strong for dry skin, but it may be good for oily skin!"
953,11646,2017-03-17,Enzyme washing face,"I use it as a face wash every night.
Because there were many reviews that are concerned with nulls after washing, how about? I thought, but it is certainly worrisome with nulls when it is used with lather by hand.
If you use plenty of lather on the net, it does not matter if you are wondering.
There was no drying of the skin, the dirt of the day felt refreshed! I feel it.
The scent looks like a kitchen detergent.
It is not a fragrance that can be relaxed, so those who do not expect it. . .
The enzyme seems not to be very strong, it is gentle to the skin, but pore stains are not fast. It is good to keep patient."
954,11646,2017-03-16,Cleansing gel Alba Botanica,"I really liked this umyvalka, I do not buy it for the first time, I use it with my daughter in the morning. I really like that she does not dry the skin (I have it prone to fat), washed to ""squeak"". With constant use, the effect of polishing the skin is observed. This, I think, because of the enzymes in the composition. The composition is very good, without harmful constituents. Bought and will buy again. Very satisfied."
955,11646,2017-01-05,"Well, but do not overstay the main thing","If you feel on the face for more than 30 seconds, the skin turns red and an unpleasant sensation appears, as if a light burn. Redness goes through a couple of hours. If on the contrary immediately washed off, then the remedy does not have time to work and the pores do not narrow."
956,11646,2016-11-28,The best for me,"I tried a bunch of washbasins. It seems that there is such a thing, but there is a difference! My requirements: to cleanse the face and eyes, cleaned cosmetics completely, did not irritate, nebylo sensation of the film (as from some expensive brands). I try different and still come back to this. I do not remember how many bottles I used up. The botanist alba has coconut milk, it is quite different (it does not foam). With coconut (deep cleansing) did not like."
957,11646,2016-10-28,Soft pleasant umyvalka.,"I liked the means for washing. It is normally normal foaming. It can not cope with the removal of full-fledged make-up from the face. I used it as a means for washing after hydrophilic oil to remove the oil residue. The lack of a strong tightness and dryness of the skin, like after mass market washbasins."
958,11646,2016-10-27,Really cool washbasin!,"I'll start with the fact that I'm allergic to almost all the chimotic drugs for the skin-pulls my face and become covered with red spots of a leopard. I was very surprised that after washing, I did not feel like a deep-sea fish thrown out on the scorching sun, but on the contrary, I felt pleasant moisture. The spots were not covered, the face was clean, the make-up was washed off with cheers. Ordered with a friend, she, too, is delighted. In general, take it, do not regret it"
959,11646,2016-10-27,Liked it,"The smell did not particularly understand what, you need very little remedy, the skin after washing is smooth and not dry. From minuses - the dispenser spits at sharp pressing on it. It is squeezed out more than necessary. With this you need to adapt. I want to try other products of this brand."
960,11646,2015-12-29,Good gel,"Gel foam, cleans the skin well, but tonalnik neprobyvala smyvat.tapah pleasant, but it is necessary to wash off carefully, as it can tighten the skin a little. This capacity is enough for a long time since the soap itself is economical. Voobshchem I am happy or enough with this umyvalkoj."
961,11646,2013-06-16,"Average, I expected more. I use d / makeup remover.","The composition is excellent! The smell nice, so gentle, pineapple, texture jelly-shaped gel, a single tap is enough for washing. Personally, I only use at night, washing makeup, and then use another umyvalku acne) Inflammation does not provoke, I also have sensitive skin, first 3-5 seconds pricked, and it was after, it was much more pleasant to wash. Maybe next time I will take another."
962,11646,2013-02-21,Largely because bad,"Too bad, but because writing is also very good, second headache. The write transfer shall I ride it. Daily cleaning is not needed, use only dual flush. Inde smell of pineapple flavor jjireupnida a little nose. He Jin is a rich foam. If you are like me, it's a give it one after the score if not irritating. Binary is irritating. If urine output when the old peeled off to another product .. ^^"
963,11646,2020-11-22,,"Large volume and convenient dispenser, pleasant citrus scent. Does not foam strongly, rinses off quickly. It looks like a transparent gel. Sensitive can pinch the eyes, gently affects the skin. Suitable for dry and sensitive, no irritation."
964,11646,2020-09-01,Horsho,"The product was well packaged. Pleasant citrus scent that does not sting the eyes. Otherwise, nothing special. Most likely, there will be no repeat purchase."
965,11646,2023-07-21,,It's too dry for me so it didn't suit me. I used it on my body because it was a waste
966,11646,2023-06-19,,A little bit of a push and tangy. I wonder if there will be a repeat. The scent was nice.
967,11646,2023-05-26,,"The scent is very good, but the effect is inferior compared to the powdered one."
968,11646,2023-04-19,,"The taste is very sweet, and it has no effect for a week, and there is no sensitivity"
969,11646,2023-04-06,,"The scent is tropical and my skin is moisturized, so it was good!"
970,11646,2022-12-26,,"Nice facial soap, for everyday use. Leaves the face clean and fresh."
971,11646,2022-10-30,,"After cleaning, it is quite refreshing and can gently exfoliate, but the smell is weird, it feels too strong, not very used to it"
972,11646,2022-10-24,,"The smell is wonderful, but that's about it. I was not happy with the cleaning result. I wanted to wash my face again"
973,11646,2022-06-30,,"Good product, excellent quality, reasonable prices. I recommend to buy!"

983,11646,2022-09-20,,"It was effective for keratotic plugs. If you put it on your skin, it will irritate, so it may not be very good for people with sensitive skin."
984,11646,2022-08-24,favorite,"A little liquid texture but high quality, pleasant and tropical smell. Convenient packaging with pump, fair size. I use it every day and I have sensitive and delicate skin. There are benefits, moisturizing. Suitable for any age."
985,11646,2022-07-19,,"It's not as smooth as I expected, and I don't think the pores have improved that much. It is a pump type and easy to use, and it feels just right for washing your face in the morning."
986,11646,2022-03-02,,"It will be slippery. Perfectly clean pores at once! It's not, but it's definitely getting better. The scent is a little vinegar-like pineapple. I want to continue using it!"
987,11646,2022-02-05,In that order,"The ingredients are great, the scent is wonderful and leaves the skin relatively pleasant to the touch after it and not dry and stuck, but it does not foam at all and it prevents me from a good face wash experience"
988,11646,2022-02-04,,"There is almost no bubbling, so it feels unsatisfactory, but it seems that the dirt has been removed. I didn't care because there was almost no scent."
989,11646,2021-09-01,Good remedy,"The smell is pleasant, it copes with its functions, but it does not foam well. Perhaps, on the contrary, it is good from the point of view of composition, but washing is not very comfortable. Of course, this is a purely personal opinion, but she removed the star for it. Although the remedy was advised by the beautician's daughter's teenager in the fight against acne"
990,11646,2021-08-29,,"I wonder why I didn't buy it until now. I like it very much. It eliminates the roughness of the skin. I use it at night, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels chewy. I will definitely buy it again! Don't lose it!"
991,11646,2021-08-26,Did you expect too much?,"I bought it because it was on sale and the price was reasonable. Use a whipping net because it does not foam with just your hands. It's refreshing after washing. I don't really feel the goodness of the enzyme I was expecting, whether my skin was too rough or I was expecting it too much. It was nice to have a refreshing finish!"
992,11646,2021-08-08,For roughness of the nose and chin,"I am using a pump type. After washing your face, 1 push, massage directly to your nose and chin. I think the number of keratin plugs has decreased and the skin has become smoother!"
993,11646,2021-07-22,,"I have replaced it many times already. It is never missing from my daily cleaning routine, it leaves my skin very soft and clean, it smells delicious and with natural ingredients. I have been using it for years and I will continue buying it ☺️"
994,11646,2021-05-24,Wonderful!,"I discovered this miracle remedy that fills my soul and bathroom with the aroma of fruits! copes with cosmetics perfectly, washes the face almost to a squeak, but does not dry, from the minuses, it came without a dispenser, sometimes I forget to close the lid, which is not ice ... I recommend buying! Upd: the product is quite economical, it lasted for a long time, I order it again. I lower the rating for false information - nevertheless, the packaging does not contain a dispenser, the site is misleading us!"
995,11646,2021-05-06,,"It's refreshing to use! The photo was a pump type, but the actual product was a cap type. This is fine as you can adjust the amount you put out."
996,11646,2021-03-25,,"Works well on oily problem skin. Does not dry. Of the minuses - it is quite liquid, the consumption is uneconomical, it foams poorly, it is not washed off well, all the time it seems that the product is left on the face. The first few times, the skin turned red after washing."
997,11646,2021-03-13,excellent! recommended!,"Excellent face wash! Purifies skin! Gently active enzymes, secrete a bond between matte cells. This way, with rinsing, we get clean and glowing skin! Excellent!"
998,11646,2021-03-13,,"I take this product for the second time, I really like it. Conveniently with a dispenser, wonderful aroma, high-quality skin cleansing. An economical tool that lasts for a long time."
999,11646,2021-03-11,,"It does not clean the pores on its own, but it quite successfully keeps them clean. It will not remove black dots on its own. Pores tighten a little. I won't tell you about post-acne and age spots, I don't suffer from them. But if the mask does not remove, then I doubt that the gel is capable of this. The gel works great in a pair with a Hawaiian mask, and in the summer this couple is just a salvation for acid lovers, for oily and combi skin. The face stays clean and fresh longer, soft and smooth. The complexion is also pleasing."
1000,11646,2021-01-27,,"Tropically styled washbasin, it smells of pineapple and gives the effect of a pineapple-citrus wash to the touch, the skin is slippery, very clean and smooth, does not dry absolutely, but cleans perfectly. The feeling of freshness and cleanliness remains all day."
1001,11646,2021-01-26,,"Smells awesome! Not pineapple, as the name suggests, but some kind of citrus potpourri. Does not dry the skin, gentle lather, economical dispenser. I love Alba Botanica products and this product is one of my favorites."
1002,11646,2021-01-25,Strange remedy,"This cleansing gel contains enzymes that break down the bonds that keep old dead cells away from new ones. But after applying it, my face turns red very much, I advise you not to keep it on the skin for a long time and you must definitely apply the cream later!"
1003,11646,2021-01-24,,"The agent in the form of a gel, quite active, dries normal skin a little in winter, so I use it only in summer. Cleans well, even the remains of cosmetics. Suitable for lovers of washing ""to a squeak"" but gentle means. The dispenser is convenient, the product is dispensed economically."
1004,11646,2021-01-22,Great cleansing gel,"One of my favorites, I bought it more than once. Soft but cleans well. Suitable for both dry and oily skin, the composition is very good."
1005,11646,2020-12-18,Good,It is a type that does not easily foam. The scent is also refreshing and good. I don't have to use a nose pack because I can wash my pores well. I will repeat.
1006,11646,2020-05-19,Great cleansing gel,"excellent gel, after the first time the face turned a little red for a short time, this is apparently how enzymes work) perfectly cleans the face, the face is smooth like after a scrub, For those who are prone to oily skin, be sure to try it, like it"
1007,11646,2020-05-17,One of the best!,"For me, this tool is very suitable. The face after him is felt deeply washed. I bought it twice and I think I'll buy it again, despite the fact that I really want to try a lot more. And it doesn’t pinch your eyes at all."
1008,11646,2020-02-24,I like the scent and feel,"I think it's perfect for those who want to cleanse their skin, but don't want to dry or put a strain on their skin. This is not a make-up remover, but if it's a natural make-up, it will fall off."
1009,11646,2019-10-26,Quality tool,"Pleasant wash. Washes not to creak, but at the same time you feel a clean face. The texture is liquid, the dispenser spits a little. The gel periodically dries on the dispenser, but not critically. I personally don’t really like the smell, it reminds me of some household chemicals with a fruity fragrance, but my husband smells deliciously of pineapple. UPD: over time, I still began to dry my skin"
1010,11646,2019-10-12,Great Wash,"Cool wash. Perfectly removes makeup, only need to wash off with a face sponge. After wiping his face with a cotton pad, the disc remained clean."
1011,11646,2019-01-14,To a horn plug!,"I am using it when my nostrils stopped worried, when my skin got wrinkled. I use limited parts one to twice a week, which is worrisome. I can feel the effect very much! ! The fragrance is a bit strong, so where preferences can break up."
1012,11646,2018-12-06,Worth it and even more !!!,"It cleans well, gives freshness and smoothness to the skin, does not tighten or dry. I buy regularly! Not only to myself: my mom tried and said that the washbasin is awesome! And she understands me. Draw conclusions, ladies."
1013,11646,2018-10-07,ㅊ ㅊ ㅊ ㄴ ㄴ ㄴ ㅔ ㅛ ㅛ,"Personally, Body Shop Pineapple Wash (discontinued) was the most satisfactory enzyme wash.
