0,7966,2024-07-27,Works for me!,"I have to take a full dropper, all the way filled , and I put it in about 4 oz of water and down it.  Took me a while to find something that actually works. Tinctures work faster than capsules, I find, IMHOP. Good luck insomniacs, I feel your pain. This works. The liquid is a little thicker, shake it up before using."
1,7966,2024-07-07,Makes me feel alive. ,I sometimes have trouble to sleep and have a healthy sleep schedule. But when I do I take this and everything is back on track. 
2,7966,2024-03-07,Works Great!,I deal with sleep issues - going to sleep and awakening in night.  I use the Slumber Herbal Blend to help me go back to sleep in the middle of night.  I mix it with a little water. It is a pleasant taste.  It helps relax my body and mind.
3,7966,2023-11-25,Great to get to sleep,This sleep product has a great benefit for getting you to sleep. The dosage is 2 droppers full in a glass of water. The taste is kinda strong. I swallow it down like a shot and try not to think about it. 
4,7966,2023-02-07,,"Getting the 2mg is very good. Ir is sweet, easy to open. I believe it is good quality. It is very nice to have for a nap. It is a good dosage. I get extra health benefit from it. Is tastes good. I prefer the larger size. The ingredients are pure."
5,7966,2024-09-16,Works okay keeping you asleep ,I found that this at first helped me fall and stay asleep but after about a week of using it I was consistently waking up and tossing and turning during the night. Melatonin has the same effect on me so maybe that‚Äôs just a personal response I have 
6,7966,2023-10-09,Slumber Herbal Blend Drops ,"I used slumber herbal blend drops for occasional sleeplessness. I followed the directions on dosage and took 1 ml dropper of slumber drops to start and I didn't feel sleepy after 2 hours, so I took 2 ml of slumber drops and it did the trick, I fell asleep  and stayed asleep the whole night. I like that it was also alcohol free and easy to take in a little water. The packaging was nice."
7,7966,2023-06-10,,"This tincture is very effective! For dosage I use two droppers for me in a little kombucha before sleep and  it send you off to a deep sleep! It has herbal taste, but not too bad when taken with juice or kombucha.
I even give it to my child (one dropper) who has a tough time falling asleep! Great quality, safe ingredients and very effective! The benefit is that it doesn‚Äôt create dependency like many other over-the-counter sleep aids!"
8,7966,2024-09-29,Great Sleep,"I used to just take Valerian root but this is far better, even calms the emotions"
9,7966,2024-03-18,For relaxing and immune ,I take it in combination with other supplements to boost immune 
10,7966,2024-02-22,Great product to help sleep!,"Love this product, super reliable to help you fall asleep. Natural ingredients and clean product, great company! Only downside is it tastes terrible."
11,7966,2023-12-10,,"Excellent additive, liked the quality, liked the price and packaging, advise you to buy"
12,7966,2024-10-11,Love the alcohol free formula,"Hasn't helped hugely with sleep, but I appreciate this brand providing alcohol free tinctures. "

14,7966,2023-07-01,Excellent tincture for sleep.,"I like that it's not based on alcohol. The potency is great. I will order this again, it will be a regular reordering item for me. It helps to avoid pharmaceutical sleeping pills."
15,7966,2024-08-04,Slumber Herbal Blend,I'm not sure if this actually helped me or not. 
16,7966,2024-05-05,Didn't do the trick for me.,Not for me. Lemon Balm helps much more. Try that!
17,7966,2023-06-05,,"Great for kids. No complaints & is a strong mix. Herbs are in good base


"
18,7966,2023-09-05,slumber tea,I am neutral on this one.  I plan to take it for hopefully better sleep.  I have only used it once so far tho so not enough to give it a good rating.
19,7966,2022-06-01,Amazing ,This product is the only thing I have found to help me sleep. 8 drops in my sleepy time tea st night is like magic. 
20,7966,2023-07-24,,So good for sleep and anxiety. Makes me feel really relaxed before bed and can fall asleep much quicker. 
21,7966,2022-08-18,,"All and all this works and the taste isn't so bad compared to others that I have tried. The reason why to me it's only average is because the concentration is too low. One dose is 59 drops (the bottle lasts 15 days only) and it does not feel enough for me. Other brands I tried had a higher concentration and fewer drops were needed for the same effect, meaning it was easier to get a higher dosage.
I would still recommend drops rather that pills as they are more effective for me for my insomnia and anxiety. This one is just not what I am looking for."
22,7966,2023-02-25,,"Very strong tasting, lures you to sleep in about an hour, sensation comes on slow then intensely pulling you forcing you to rest"
23,7966,2022-06-06,,It's very good composition of these drops. They really help me to sleep.  In the morning there is no any head haviness. I'll buy it next time.
24,7966,2014-09-28,Helps me get back to sleep,"If I have a lot on my mind or hormonal issues, I often will wake up at 3-4am...and can not get back to sleep for several hours. When I have this by my bed with a glass of water, I reach over in the dark and gulp about 1/4 of the bottle and take a drink of water. I am back to sleep and on with my life usually in 30 minutes. $2.50 is nothing when it compares with not getting back to sleep and feeling like crap the whole next day. Works great for me"
25,7966,2023-05-30,,Seemed to be a good composition formula and tastes ok but wasn‚Äôt effective
26,7966,2017-04-22,It Works For Me!!,"I've been using this product for a couple of months now, along with a few other extracts that I mix in my nightly ""Sleepy Bomb Tea"" ;)   
It really works for me... but I also believe in the power of suggestion and Faith!!  
I just put faith in the products... I told myself ""This conconction WILL WORK for me""
""I will have a good night sleep after I drink this"" ... . and I do!!
It used to take me a while to fall asleep and I used to wake up more than 4 times every night... 
 After I started taking this, I fall asleep pretty quick and I don't wake up at all.... I sleep all throughout the night and I don't wake up Groggy either.......
My ""Sleepy Bomb Tea"" consist of:    SLUMBER 20 drops......
1 ""Nighty Night Tea Bag (Brand..Traditional Medicinals, Available through this website as well).......20 Drops of Nature's Answer Chamomille Extract(Alcohol Free) .......10 drops of  Linden extract (Low Alcohol).
Btw I did lots of research on extracts for Sleep, relaxation and antianxiety which is why I felt that it was safe for me to mix this extracts... But do your own research!! and maybe start with less drops and work your way up.. 
Everybody's  System is different.....I hope this mix could help out someone else.. like it helps me.
Good luck!"

30,7966,2022-08-15,,"This is really nice, but I like even more products whithout alcohol."
31,7966,2016-12-20,Does it work?? Not sure about it...,Bought this as was going travelling long haul around Europe and Asia. Was hoping it would help with inducing sleep/making sleep quality better but to be honest I'm not entirely certain it had much of an impact. Possibly a slight placebo effect in knowing you're taking something for slight. 
32,7966,2023-05-30,,"Nope‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt help me AT ALL. I bought 2 bottles  assuming it would work. Bummer. However, it may work great for someone else."

36,7966,2020-10-31,,Works somewhat well but not anywhere near as well as a similar formula made with alcohol. Proven ingredient mixture. Easy to take.

And if you also leave the phone in the next room, the process happens even faster and more efficiently! üòâ Convenient to dose, I love these bottles with pipettes in the lid. The taste is herbaceous, but pleasant, even a little sweet. So the benefits of herbs, in my opinion, are undeniable, even in comparison with melatonin, which has not the most pleasant side effects. "
