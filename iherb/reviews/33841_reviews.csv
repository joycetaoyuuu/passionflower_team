"
9,33841,2016-11-03,Up throughout the  night and feeling cruddy this morning,"I just got this yesterday and tried it last night.  It's been awful.  I took one pill before bed and was wired as if I had had 2-3 cups of very strong coffee.  I slept the first two hours then was up every hour until the morning tossing and turning with feelings of shock and panic when I heard noises.  This product really did the opposite of what I bought it for.  I definitely will not be trying it again and hope the jitters and headache don't last far into this new day.  

I tried to get on the companies website but the connection timed out and it doesn't load.  "
