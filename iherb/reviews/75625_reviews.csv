However, I am amazed by a lady with oily skin, acquiring such remedies, and then writing ""it clogs the pores"". Surprised by the ladies, waiting for that CARE cosmetics will remove their wrinkles on the forehead. Lovely, for you there is such a lifhak - a beautician! The first zafigachit carbon, the second fillers with botulinum toxins!

157,75625,2020-12-11,,"My face skin has always reacted very badly to any oil (rash). I bought and tried this product a little with apprehension for the first time, but the result exceeded expectations. The skin really becomes velvety with it (I have it mixed, 36 years old), and there are no unpleasant effects of clogging pores with it. I mainly use it only in the morning with a massage roller (black obsidian), then blot my face with a napkin and apply nourishing / BB cream. In the evening I use only with guache (stone massager for the face)."
158,75625,2020-03-04,Cool Oil,"Very pleased with this oil! I have dry skin, often there are problems with the selection of funds.

I applied it at night under the cream, and during the day as an independent product, and the effect was enough for me, although usually I need more hydration. The smell is quite pleasant, it smells strongly the first minutes after application. By the way, I recommend using a pipette directly on the face, and not on the hands, as recommended on the package. So it turns out much more economical. Oil is similar to Kils night oil, but lighter! I could not use Kills during the day, otherwise it was like a pancake. I will order more."
159,75625,2019-08-20,Great Oil!,"Previously used face oil, adding a drop to the cream. My skin is dry and, after reading reviews of this oil, I decided to try. Now my morning ritual for face care has changed, after washing I apply serum, then I drop a couple drops of oil on my palm, rub it and put it on my face, very pleasant sensations and aroma, then a day cream. The skin is radiant. Recommend"
160,75625,2018-09-30,Valuable oil,"The taste is very fragrant, this one absorbs faster. I mix it with Marula oil and rosehip oil. Each oil drop is 2 drops on the palm of my hand. After rubbing the palm of my hand, it is very hydrating, moisturizing and softening the skin. It is expensive in sea buckthorn and hemp seed oil, anti-aging, vitamin C, whitening, calming anti-inflammatory, anti-wrinkle moisturizing, problem skin. Although a little expensive, I mix other oils together, so one can be used for a long time."
161,75625,2017-12-16,I will do it.,"After plenty of moisturizing with lotion, take several drops of this and let it fit the neck and neck. And lid with cream or butter. Then, moistly moist. This will last. For single item, it is smooth and familiar to the skin, it does not sticky. There seem to be some people using oil as a booster, but I do not feel any such oils with such effects. Even so oil with good skin familiarity. After all, I think that it is more effective to keep moisturizing before oil. The fragrance is scent of raw materials and it looks like yellow flower. Essential oils and base oils are purchased at European sites because they want high quality items, but as long as they are pleased to find such sophisticated products here. On this site it is expensive but it is a difficulty to use with homebrews so plan to do it again."
162,75625,2016-12-19,Powerful Anti-Aging Oil Elixir,"Powerful Anti-Aging Oil Elixir. Literally - medicine, balm for the skin. Very well moisturizes it, makes it silky, sleek, well-groomed. Only two drops are needed to be easily spread on the skin of the face, neck, and decollete moist from the tonic. Therefore, a bottle with a pipette is the most successful solution for packing this mixture of oils. From above I smear any cream from my endless coffers, with all it works just fine.

The oils of sea-buckthorn, jojoba and passionflowers penetrate deeply into the skin and are responsible for moistening it, regulate the production of sebum, help to clean and close the enlarged pores, make the skin soft and silky. The essential oil of geranium helps to stimulate blood circulation and regeneration of new skin cells. In addition to this, there are also olive oil, hemp oil, camellia oil seed oil and taman oil. In-general paradise combination. I love and I use constantly."
163,75625,2016-10-06,A very good purchase,"After using the antioxidant oil of Mad Hippie I decided to try this as the brand was with a 20% discount and I am delighted with the purchase! I use facial oil as the last step of my routine almost every night to hydrate, and with this I am very happy.

I love the smell, color and texture of this oil, and make the timing of the application super nice. The face is hydrated and juicy but not too greasy (we can not forget that it is an oil). I mean it is absorbed quite well.
Another point in favor is the packaging, which although not the most important in a product is also something to take into account. The simple aesthetics of this brand I like a lot and is up to the product.

To finish I will say that my skin is ""normal"", but this oil is recommended for all types of skins."

Does not clog pores, I have been using it for the 5th day, the skin is clean and smooth despite the large amount of oils in the serum. After it, no cream is needed anymore. I'll add a review in a month. But I'm happy so far."
167,75625,2017-04-15,Oil for shine,"I have a combined skin with the first signs of aging. I use in the morning under make-up: A few drops of oil I rub a little in my hands and put on my face. I use the serum or cream on top. The oil is well absorbed, there is no excess fatty shine. Most of all I was afraid that I could clog pores like similar products. But there seems to be no such effect. As a whole, I do not observe any unusual action, but my face looks somewhat fresh when applied."
168,75625,2016-09-16,My love!,"I liked the oil for the incredible smell of geranium! It is enough 2 drops, it is absorbed instantly (a skin normal with a small dryness in a cold season).

181,75625,2019-10-17,I have my own way to use this oil),"I have combination skin, all my life my cheeks nose and forehead are oily, with enlarged pores. After pregnancy, the skin type became completely incomprehensible, now very dry, then dehydrated, then oily. I really wanted smoothness, nourishment, moisturizing and removing (rather than oily sheen). In general, in life, oil on the skin of the face is not my story at all, they are not absorbed into me and after five minutes, the oily droplets treacherously shine at each pore. After meeting with the serum, JJ The Light decided to try to risk ordering this oil. Use as recommended by the manufacturer did not suit me. Therefore, I do this - pour a little Aloe in my palm (I have it from Instanatural - and it‚Äôs just great) and drop 2-3 drops of The Glow serum into it - mix and apply on the face. In this form, the effect is wonderful, the oil is perfectly absorbed, the skin looks really sleek, not oily. Now that the heating is turned on, this serum is my must have (but only paired with Aloe). You can still spray thermal water on your face and apply the glow on top of wet skin, but still the Aloe option is perfect for me!"
