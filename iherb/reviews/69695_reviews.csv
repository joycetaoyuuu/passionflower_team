0,69695,2024-10-11,Perfect for Anxious Dogs,"These calming chews have been a lifesaver for my dog! She gets really anxious during thunderstorms and car rides, but after giving her these, she‚Äôs so much calmer. I like that it has melatonin for a natural calming effect without making her too sleepy. She also loves the taste, so no issue getting her to eat them. Highly recommend for any dog with anxiety!

4,69695,2024-07-09,helps my dogs calm down,"This helps my dogs calm down. I use half of what is suggested on the bottle if they are just a little agitated about visitors or other events. I use what they suggest for bigger triggers like fireworks. It seems to take about 30 minutes to kick in, so plan ahead some."
5,69695,2024-05-05,Works!,"This definitely works on my anxious dog. She weighs about 4 1/2 kg so I only give her half a tablet and within 20 minutes. It starts to kick in. I normally give this to her before guests arrive or if I know we‚Äôre going to a crowded place to walk.
This has lasted me nearly a year because I don‚Äôt give it to her often "

7,69695,2024-03-08,My Pup Loves the Flavor,My 13  year old is terrified of storms & fireworks. I keep Quiet Moments close by in preparation of the inevitable. Knowing storms are moving in & fireworks during some holidays I give my Princess Kimmy one 10-15 minutes prior. She no longer trembles while staring at me terrified. I think it is important to care for our fur babies and show love as they show unconditional love to us.

19,69695,2023-10-23,,These are great for my dog and he just loves them. They have Brewer's yeast which is good to help control shedding and they are my dog's favorite treat of all.
20,69695,2024-10-10,Average effectiveness,"My dogs appreciate the size and taste of the product, and the ingredient list/composition looks good.  The two dogs easily accept it and chew it but we have not noticed any significant calming effect on them.  One dog in particular is terrified of fireworks and despite taking the product, she is still so scared....   But I will continue giving this to them when needed, and hopefully, will see a difference in their stress and anxiety levels."
21,69695,2023-10-27,,"I was really hoping this would work for my dogs. They get very anxious riding in cars. Unfortunately, this didn‚Äôt work for my dogs but they worked great for my mom‚Äôs dogs. I‚Äôve found that these items don‚Äôt automatically work on every dog so they might work for you."
22,69695,2024-04-18,I am not sure how well this works,I am not sure how well this works as my dog is still pretty anxious even after taking it on a daily basis. She continues to bark a lot. I give her 2 a day with her food. May consider altering the dosage.
23,69695,2024-06-16,great product,saves us from our dog trashing the house when storms are happening 
24,69695,2022-10-30,,"Bought this for my geriatric dog who has advanced dementia. It does calm him down and help him sleep through the night. But on bad days where he wakes up in the middle of the night and starts pacing, I give him another dose and it usually takes about 30 minutes for him to calm down and start resting. I only give this to him at night since he doesn't have pacing problems in the day. "
25,69695,2022-10-28,,"Excelent product and a awsome fast shipping service! I wasnt sure about The shopping but when I got The goods and Tried on mi dog I realised that it really was a good deal to get it!
We have a Golden Retriver and She was losing all her hair. The vet told us to try melatonina. I was doing some reserch to buy a good product and we all get really happy with purchase because it really Worked for us and finally I May get our home clean for some more days without be worried of dog‚Äôs hair.  "
26,69695,2024-07-05,Did not notice a calming effect,"Have given my 10 lb dog a few times and have not noticed a difference. Did not help with her anxiety during thunderstorms or fireworks. Even tried giving her 2 , still did not have any effect.  She liked the taste though."

28,69695,2023-05-28,,"I bought these for a friend, her dog is so scared of storm noises. She tried the expensive mother milk from the Vet, but no dosage helped.. But these made him calm in no time üôè You need to look on the back side of how many servings you need depending on the weight of your dog. The quality is great and the use is simple. If your dog doesn't want to eat it, put it in a bit of sausage üòâ"

30,69695,2023-01-23,Good for calming ,"I bought this for my dog while traveling to a new place since she would normally be filled with anxiety and start drooling non stop or marking. After administering this it worked for close to 8 hours. I was amazed that my dog is calmer, didn‚Äôt drool and we didn‚Äôt need to put on a diaper for her. We put it in the food and she ate it up. I have started recommending this to others as well. "
31,69695,2022-11-11,,"Works well on my dog with separation anxiety. She loves the taste (gobbled it down in a second) and it worked about 30mins-1hr in (gradually increases effect). Normally she paces and whines significantly in her crate but now she manages to lie in her bed for 90% of the time, though still somewhat distressed/panting. Needs to be paired with further desensitization training to get a dog with anxiety to be calm with us away, but works great as an aid to training. Seems to be made with quality ingredients asit visibly calmed her down for most of the day, unlike another brand I used. "

54,69695,2024-01-01,Did not work for my dog,"My 2 stars isn't exactly a reflection of the product itself it's just they don't work for my dog.  It's actual my dog (he's a 5.5 lb Chihuahua) since nothing I have purchased has worked except one and it's been discontinued. It's a large container.  I was initially glad to see that.  However, since they don't work for my dog, the large size does not serve me well.  My dog loves them but they don't calm him down.

60,69695,2022-08-15,,"It works! I have a 1 year old shih tzu who got spayed recently, and she started barking at bedtime when she NEVER use to before (change of behavior and caused anxiety). I give her 1 chew, and it keeps her calm and relaxed (not drowsy at all). She stopped barking at bedtime which is a miracle. If you have a shih tzu who has separation anxiety or barks a lot give this a try. "
61,69695,2023-05-30,,"Good ingredients. I had to give my dog double the recommended dosage because it was not working at first. But after a few days, it seemed to have a positive effect on my dog's attitude. He was more quiet and didn't bark as much. But this was also accompanied with consistent training. "

76,69695,2023-01-17,,Helped my dog with her fears related to thunder storms. She loves the chews and takes them without any trouble. She is 3 years old and has always been scared during bad weather.
77,69695,2024-09-20,,"This did not do ANYTHING for my dog, not really sure how it is supposed to work, but if you have a dog that is destroying things at home nad you think this will help calm him down, it didn't work for me."

81,69695,2021-10-30,Works everytime,"My dog is 15 and suffers from anxiety. which is why it's not easy when guests come over as he gets into barking sprees. Quiet moments usually works within 30 mins to calm him. Even on nights when he doesn't get sleep and is edgy, two chews does the trick. It helps him and helps us get some sleep too. "

86,69695,2023-04-29,,"My dog is very picky with supplements, but surprisingly, he seems to like the taste of it. It does calm him down for a little bit when I need to leave the house. It would be nice if the chews were slightly smaller in size, but overall would recommend.  "
87,69695,2023-01-05,,The treats are a good size but not sure if its calming enough to get my dog through really bad situations but i think its a complementary treat to other support system .
88,69695,2022-08-26,Very good,"I've had to use this a couple of times and it seems to have worked very well in calming a distressed dog.

The seizures are not as frequent and severe as they used to be. When I give it in the morning he is as active as always, it is not a depressant. I'll keep buying it. "
90,69695,2020-05-03,Incredible product,"Our tea cup Pomeranian is blind and we lost our beautiful border collie who was her adopted nana bell. Her eyes and ears. After she died our little pom went bald, totally lost all of her hair and was terrified of everything.

143,69695,2020-12-16,"It works, and cost-effective supplement","It works very well especially at night. My dog sometimes keep barking with no reason, so quite annoying and disturbing to my child. so I just tried this supplement before (the smaller container) and helped calm my dog. Because of this, I decided to purchase the bigger one for regular use. It dont keep my dog excessively drowsy, unlike some brands. Based on my experience, you need to give around half to 1 hour to calm your dog. And you need to adjust the dose too. Even my dog is around 7 kg, he requires only 1 chew to make him calm at night. You need to do some adjustment, and always follow the instruction to ensure it works for your dog"
144,69695,2020-08-14,It certainly has given us all some....QUIET MOMENTS !,One of our elderly dogs is suffering with Canine Dementia......believe it or not animals can also  suffer with Dementia just like humans can.  The little Lhasa Apso was doing a lot of roaming at night and scratching at doors and creating a general disturbance. Nothing seemed to work.  I even landed up placing pillows and cushions up against all the doors to stop her scratching.  And then Quiet Moments arrived in the post from America......what marvellous service. I had only ordered it online  a few days before.  Within a short space of time it started having the desired effect.  
145,69695,2020-04-04,Finally something that helps my elderly dog sleep during the night,"My elderly dog was unable to settle at night time, crying and barking, which was distressing for her and keeping the rest of the household awake. I tried other herbal treatments, which had no effect. However, these with the added melatonin have worked like magic. I give my dog 1 Quiet Moment at bedtime, I stay around her for about 15 - 20 min, untill she is settled in her bed and then she sleeps the whole night through ( as do we). "
146,69695,2018-04-13,It calms our dog's anxiety !,"Our Westie started having anxiety with storms and would shake at the sound of them . At first we thought it would pass because he was 8 years old when it developed . After awhile we started looking for something to help him through them . After using this product a few times , it was evident it worked well as he was mellow and even sleeping through the storms . We don't have to use it every time it storms , but if there is a lot of lightning expected , he gets one 15 or 20 minutes before the storm arrives . No negative side effects and we highly recommend ."
147,69695,2017-12-06,Recommended!,I have tried several brands of herbal supplements in hope of calming my dog (young/medium sized mixed breed) when I bring her to the vet/groomer. This is by far the only product that my dog happily chomps down and it works! My dog is noticeably calmer . I will definitely re-purchase this!
148,69695,2023-07-24,,"doesn't help calm my dog I have a maltese dog and he is always anxious when we cut his nails, this didn't help one bit with his anxiety not recommended"
149,69695,2021-07-10,,"My dog sufferes horrible anxiety from fireworks. Ive tried nearly every calming method I could find, but nothing helped at all.  While this didnt help as much as I had hoped, I did see a bit of a difference. She was worked up, but not as much and not as long. I would recommend this."
150,69695,2023-05-01,,"Quite a good product.

Will definitely buy it again in future."

156,69695,2022-01-02, Not So Calming ,This product was not for my pup. She didn‚Äôt like the taste. If melatonin  is one of the ingredients in it it‚Äôs not enough. So the quality of this product is not great. 
157,69695,2021-06-17,,"I think it does work, however my dog doesn‚Äôt really like it, he wouldn‚Äôt eat it alone as a treat. I have to break it up and mix it in with his food for him to eat it. Other than this, I think it works for dog that has anxiety issues and chronic diseases. "
