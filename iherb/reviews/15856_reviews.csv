I was frankly skeptical that these would work, but within an hour of taking my first of these Lung Tonic tablets, my chest cleared of mucus and the wracking cough that I wake up with every day was more or less gone.
I thoroughly recommend these, they are well worth the money."
59,15856,2020-12-15,Excellent product. Helps me tremendously.,"This is a great product I was recovering from a fungal pneumonia (haven't heard of it... well that's because it's rare... it can come from living in a home with black mold- yes gross!). In my recovery my breathing wasn't so great and from my scans ""ground glass"" was evident.  I don't like taking traditional medications with the side effects. This product helped me over time tremendously to where my doctor said she saw the potential for a complete recovery without the harsh medications she thought I would need. I felt no side effects, no bad taste, no ""repeat"" (burping it up), no upset stomach, nothing... and week by week got better.  My doctor said I don't know what you are doing but keep it up. Eventually she asked me what I took(took a picture even) and said she would look into it herself as she was highly intrigued with my progress.  I am a true believer of this product and iHerb sent out my product faster than expected and was well priced.  It arrived securely packed.  Excellent buy! "
60,15856,2014-02-28,A Great Product.,"I have COPD and purchased this product and Deep Health, both made by Herbs, Etc.  I stopped using my Advair inhaler once I started using these two products. Like all these products that are organic and natural, it takes time to work through you whole system.  You can't heal one part of the body and not another.  Everything needs to be healed and this takes time, proper diet and proper supplements.  I highly recommend this product for people with lung issues. Superb product and company. "

Many other soothing herbs. Good stuff"
88,15856,2020-03-20,Great natural medicine!,"My 79 y.o dad has severe COPD, ASTMA and a bunch of additional diseases (heart failure etc.).  These little capsules help him to go through the time between  asthma inhalers that he inhales in the morning and in the evening. He also gets extra oxygene.  Still there's an improvement in how he feels and he has now more power to walk on stairs."

90,15856,2013-10-09,"Fast Acting,  Great Alternative to Conventional Asthma and COPD Meds","FINALLY an alcohol-free non-pharmaceutical remedy that slows the scratchy itch in my throat which causes constant coughing. I have asthma.  I am allergic to alcohol in conventional inhalers, like Albuterol, whose principal ingredient is ""dehydrated alcohol""/pure ethanol, and which makes me very sick.  I definitely have noticed a lessening in the intensity and frequency of the coughing, as well as less shortness of breath.  Highly recommend this product, especially if one is sensitive to inhalers and doesn't want to use steroids.(NO THANKS!)  My husband has COPD, and he has noticed an almost immediate effect and has been able to breathe more easily. .A+++"

246,15856,2020-11-16,Breath! Do not breath!,"For respiratory or lung problems, breathing problems are often exacerbated in winter or with increased exposure to air pollution or smoke. In winter, we not only more often encounter viruses that attack the respiratory tract, but also breathe more dry and warm air, which is repeatedly recirculated in the room. This air dries out the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Because of this, the mucus loses water, becomes thicker and worse for excretion from the respiratory tract. Such thick and less functional mucus becomes a fertile environment for harmful microorganisms, thereby increasing the risk of developing sinusitis, stagnation in the bronchi or lungs, and infection. The airways and lungs are covered with special cells and protected by a mucus barrier. For these cells to perform their important function, they need an uninterrupted supply of essential nutrients. They not only protect us from pollution and infection, but also play a creative role. These cells produce mucin and other protective substances that line the airways and suppress viruses and other harmful organisms. I purchased LifeSeasons, Lung Capaci-T, 90 Vegetarian Capsules to provide the lungs of my loved ones with essential nutrients."
