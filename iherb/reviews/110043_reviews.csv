The ingredients are organic and vegan friendly, which I really like and the dosage is adequate and effective.

Highly recommend!"
3,110043,2024-03-27,After a month,This thing works. I take it around 10pm and I’m all drowsy by 11.30pm. Slept well. In the day when I’m having trouble stabilizing myself with racing heart beats due to palpitations I take one and it calms me down. But obviously you do feel a little drowsy but you still function well. I don’t take more than two a day so that my body does not develop reliance on it.

It has helped me noticeably reduce anxiety at the neurological and physiological levels. Because it helps to increase GABA, I also notice an improvement in sleep when I take this before bed. I have bought more, highly recommend it. "
14,110043,2023-06-16,,"I've found it's very difficult to find herbs to help with sleep - they either do nothing or there's bad side effects. This helps me with PMT non sleep (I'm also pre menopause) and helps when I'm on medication that keeps me awake. Doesn't help with if not sleeping due to stressful situations. Very mild herb, helps sleep better than usual, so then feel better next day, no side effects. May not sleep all through the night but the improvement is well worth it! Also need to do sleep hygiene and make sure not to eat certain things past certain time that keep me awake. Also need to use intermittently, so it works better;think the body gets used to it in time."

31,110043,2022-04-04,,I chose this brand as it is organic even though it is more expensive than some others.  Passion flower is amazing for the proper function of some neurotransmitters. It works as a  GABA inhibitor which controls the build up of adrenaline and noradenaline which can be detrimental if too much stress accumulates..  Would never be without this herb.. 
32,110043,2023-12-16,Brand ok ,Passion flower alone is not much beneficial… I really not feel it. I am still waking up during the night

34,110043,2022-08-12,,I like this  form of passion flower as it is organic and has no distinct taste when  taking it.  I like the darkened glass packaging  and the fact that it only has the herb in it and nothing else added. It is excellent to help keep calm and also taking one in the evening helps to relax me so sleeping is more beneficial.  Will  take this again.
