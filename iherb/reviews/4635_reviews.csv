0,4635,2024-04-10,Good for sleep and anxiety,"This is a good passion flower supplement from a reputable brand.

Key benefits of passion flower supplements:
Anxiety relief: Several studies have found that passion flower can help reduce anxiety, including before medical procedures like surgery. The anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects are thought to be due to passion flower's impact on neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine.

Improved sleep: Passion flower has been shown to help improve sleep quality and insomnia when taken as a tea or supplement, likely due to its calming effects on the brain.

Menopausal symptom relief: Research indicates passion flower may help alleviate menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and insomnia, potentially providing an alternative to hormone therapy.

Reduced blood pressure: Animal studies suggest passion flower extract may help lower blood pressure, possibly through its antioxidant and GABA-promoting properties.

ADHD symptom improvement: Some preliminary evidence indicates passion flower may help reduce ADHD symptoms."
1,4635,2024-02-24,,Has a potent feel of passion flower in each capsule. I take this twice a day and it helps me no matter what time I take it. Can be sedative but I still enjoy it. It's great for the spirit and the body. Always works no matter what time it's taken.
2,4635,2024-04-07,Pleasant alternative to Melatonin,"Passion Flower helped me gradually relax into slumber, and with none of the groggy Melatonin hangover upon waking. It isn't a near-immediate knockout like Melatonin; PF has a more subtle effect. I would usually take a dosage of 2 capsules. "
3,4635,2023-08-15,Happy about purchase,"I was advised to get specific herbs from iherb only--as my FMP   said he had investigated ""herb companies thoroughly""--and to not get them anywhere else--I   am using his ""prescription"" of 13 different herbal formulations from iherb to get off benzos and rebuild my GABA  receptors--It's only been 2 weeks, but I am shocked at what amazing progress I am making with my goal of getting that crap out of my life with a variety of different herbal formulations from iherb--and the prices are excellent to boot--I will be ordering more soon"
4,4635,2024-02-05,No noticeable effect,"I bought these capsules hoping to ease my anxiety. I did not notice any benefit using this product. I don't think the product is bad quality, it just did not work for me. I followed the instructions on the packaging in terms of dosage."

8,4635,2024-05-27,,"Great quality, but small dosage, dose not have any taste, easy to swallow."
9,4635,2023-07-17,Great daily supplement for anxiety,"I have been taking this daily for about 3 years now, and my base level of anxiety has really improved. I can definitely tell if I forget a day or take it too late. Nothing bad at all to say about these supplements!"
10,4635,2022-06-18,,"I found out about Passion flower back in the days when I was the general manager of a busy restaurant in NYC, when the speed of my life was going at 200 miles per hour! Passion flower really helped in keeping my anxiety down and restored a sense of  calmness (which is what everyone should be striving for in life). I usually buy Passion flower from this trusted brand, Paradise Herbs, and I find the quality of their ingredients excellent. Passion flower supposedly has many other benefits, look it up on the internet! It is one of my favorite ""magic"" herbs."
11,4635,2023-03-09,,It calms and helps to fall asleep and sleep through. I still feel the calmness the morning after. It is highly recommended.

22,4635,2022-01-01,,No fillers. The capsule is very small and not entirely full. I prefer passionflower tinctures as I find them to be more effective. 
23,4635,2021-11-25,Stopped taking it,"This was supposed to make me feel calmer so that I can fall asleep. It did not. Instead, I  found myself waking up around 3-5 am anytime I took it. Could not fall back asleep. 

Maybe it's a great supplement with quality ingredients but in my case not something I would touch again by itself. There are mixes with tiny amounts of this that I do fine with. "
