20,1236,2016-08-04,Seems to have good effect!,"First time I buy this product and maybe it is to early to evaluate,  thats why I give it only 4 stars. It seems to be a good and balanced mix of ingredients that in my case boosts my energy level. It is a very big tablet with a lot of different stuff inside, and 
 as always a good price and product from Iherb!"
21,1236,2021-04-06,,This supplement helps me to improve my Sleep and anxiety. My husband also taking this and he feels better and less stress. We will order again as this is cheap and effective.
22,1236,2014-11-25,Awesome- works in minutes,I love this stuff! Within a few minutes it releases the vise grip on my heart and calms me down. I have to take 1/2 or 1 though as 2 makes me tired. I am very small though so most medications full dosage are too strong for me.
23,1236,2014-11-20, Hi Stressi B&C is an excellent product,This is an excellent product. I was in antidepressants for two years 150MG per day. Now I take 25mg and my mood is consistently good.I take only one capsule in the evening and I have no side effects. Highly recommended.
24,1236,2013-06-02,Best product,"I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks that physically make me ill , this is the only product I have found that when taken relieves my symptoms so I can function somewhat normally. "
25,1236,2008-09-20,Best for stress,"Everyone on the planet should be taking this product - it calms and nourishes and just makes me a better person.  If we all felt better we'd be better people, and this great combination is an excellent assistant to that goal."
26,1236,2007-02-02,great stress reducer,"I lOVE this product.  When I'm stressed and I take one or two of these tablets, the rest of my day is profoundly affected.  I recommend it highly to anyone seeking relief"
27,1236,2022-04-04,,I like that they have combined B & C together. One less pill to take.
28,1236,2021-12-20,Excellent product - if you can get it.,Great product but hasn't been in stock now for months so very frustrating.
29,1236,2016-11-23,"It works, but with drawbacks","The contents of this product do their job. Especially in combination with other stress reducing supplements.

But, the drawback or downside is: it contains the wrong form of vitamin B12. And this is a serious one. I came to the conclusion that this form of vitamin B12 is the main cause of my tiredness. I did not expect this. I've taken this supplement for several years, daily.

The thing is, cyanocobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) is toxic. It is reducing the bio-available vitamin B12 in the body. This means, it is creating a deficiency of bio-available vitamin B12. Taking this supplement over a long period of time can result in severe problems in the nervous system and other areas in the body.

I hope Source Naturals will review this product on short term, because it is damaging people's health. Source Naturals (and Planetary Herbals) deliver such a high standard of quality that I'll not doubt they will try to keep it up."
30,1236,2008-01-11,Helps my mood but awful taste,"These do seem to help calm a stressful mood throughout the day and I'm always in a high stress environment with my job.  I can even handle the size of the tablets (they're rather large) but the taste is AWFUL.  It tastes like wet tree bark (must be the wood betony ingredient) and the aftertaste lingers.  If you can get past the size and the taste, it's a good product."
31,1236,2011-12-05,Didn't do the trick,"This didn't do the trick for me.
As the dosage of B's per tablet is so little, you need a bigger dosage to make it work.
That means taking more than 4 tablets a day, especially for those stressful days.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update:
It gave me that morning feeling of slight dizziness and nausea. In the beginning I thought dosage was too small. In fact now I think it was too much. To safely use it don't take it every day. Use only when needed."
32,1236,2011-07-13,Great Value for A Quality Product,"I feel less lethargic after taking 2 tables of this in the morning. Love it for its value. Pills are a little big and hard to swallow for those people who dislike big pills. 

Will continue taking it and recommend it to my friends. =)"
33,1236,2020-07-07,Hi-Stress B & C,I highly recommend this product.  It is a natural way to create a calm feeling.

43,1236,2010-04-07,Perfectly Balanced,A perfectly balanced hi-stress tablet. I like it better than a capsule and the price is acceptable too.

"
76,1236,2024-07-16,super complex,"Stress Complex (Hi-Stress B and C) is an effective nutritional supplement that helps cope with stress and its consequences. I'm very pleased with the quality. The stress complex contains B vitamins, vitamin C, amino acids and herbs, which have a positive effect on the nervous system, help you relax and make it easier to cope with stressful situations in life. Vitamin C helps maintain nutrient levels during times of stress, bringing the body back into balance. During times of stress, our body uses vitamins B6 and C to produce adrenaline and norepinephrine, hormones that help the body respond to stress. In addition, B vitamins support a healthy nervous system and are active in energy production. B vitamins and vitamin C are water soluble and therefore are not stored long in the body and require more frequent replenishment."
77,1236,2024-05-12,Satisfied,"Delivery was fast. The parcel was packed well, everything was intact. Let's check what the result will be after taking it. The nervous system has become much weaker. This is a dietary supplement that helps cope with stress and its consequences.

"
78,1236,2024-05-08,,"The composition of this supplement is simply excellent! It is recommended to take 2-4 pieces a day, but I can’t take it during the day because... It really relaxes me and I can’t do anything then. I only take it at night. Sleep is good with this dietary supplement. I recommend."
79,1236,2024-01-14,AN OPTIMISTIC PERCEPTION OF LIFE IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR A HEALTHY LIFE,"Be an optimist! Find the light even in the darkest. Believe that the world does not give trials that we cannot withstand. Any trial, no matter how difficult it seems to us, takes away great troubles from us. Envy, anger, sadness are considered sins for a reason. They have a detrimental effect on health. Laugh more often! A healthy person is usually optimistic and cheerful. Organize your thoughts. Chaos in the head is not conducive to health. Do not promise more than you can do, do not undertake what you cannot do. But don't say ""I can't"" prematurely, a person can do much more than he thinks."
80,1236,2024-01-08,great,"Complexes of water-soluble vitamins (C, PP, group B) are recommended to be taken in the morning, half an hour before meals. B vitamins can be taken with breakfast. Omega-3, 6, 9, vitamin K are better absorbed in the evening from 18.00 to 21.00. Calcium and magnesium supplements are recommended to be taken after 9:00 pm. The taste and quality are excellent."
81,1236,2024-01-07,FULL SLEEP IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR A HEALTHY LIFE,"Full healthy sleep is necessary for health, numerous studies prove that lack of sleep can lead to obesity and heart disease. People with sleep disorders are more likely to fall into stressful situations, have depression and other health problems. The need for a good night's sleep is more important for health nowadays than ever before. Doctors talked a lot about movement and nutrition, but they somehow bypassed sleep. In order to catch up, people began to sleep less. And now doctors have sounded the alarm, the obvious connection of many diseases, especially nervous and mental ones, associated with lack of sleep has been revealed. People have different need for sleep duration. But there is no doubt that the quality of sleep is one of the main factors of health. Doctors advise 7-8 hours of sleep to feel healthy, but this is not in doubt because there are people who do not need that much sleep. A healthy body is able to regulate the need for sleep duration and adjust the regime when changing time zones."
82,1236,2023-12-29,IMPORTANT RULES OF FAMILY LIFE,"In the developed world, family structure has changed dramatically. In families where both work and their elderly parents live separately, when you can buy semi-finished products or eat out, rituals, rules of conduct, expectations become different. These days, it is not tradition, but chance that decides who is responsible for what and what is required from whom. And many families live like in hell. What to do? Before getting married, lovers should sit down and, after cool-headed thinking, make a written agreement about everything. What values do they share and what assumptions cannot be broken? How many children do they want? Who will be the main breadwinner? Where will they live and what size house do they need? Who washes the dishes, and who manages the family budget? It is necessary to discuss everything openly, so that later no one complains that he is being forced to follow rules that he did not sign up for."
83,1236,2024-09-14,,"The best remedy for stress, you can take it in courses. I take 2 times a day, 1 tablet in the morning and evening. An excellent drug that contains a complex of vitamins that we cannot take every day."

I recommend this complex, because its high-quality ingredients have a positive effect on the nervous system, soothe, relax to an extent, and give energy. My friends and I use this manufacturer's product because it works really effectively."
86,1236,2024-05-26,All components in the composition help improve well-being during stress,"During stress, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and others are actively consumed. This complex will help fill the deficiency of essential nutrients. I noticed that after taking the course I began to feel calmer and began to sleep more soundly"

94,1236,2024-06-01,The effect of walking is the case,"Frankly speaking, its effect is not strong. Some people take it and imagine that it is good. The issue is psychological, nothing more or less."
95,1236,2024-05-13,There is a positive effect,"Since we now live in conditions of constant stress in Ukraine, I decided to try this supplement, but in fact, it is still difficult to evaluate its effect...
