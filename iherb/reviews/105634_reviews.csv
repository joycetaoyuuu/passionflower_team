9,105634,2023-09-01,Does It Work? I'm Not Sure,"Even though this is for kids, I use it as an adult. Does it help me fall asleep? I'm not sure. However, I've gotten used to tasting it when I go to bed & I like it. Maybe just having the flavor in my mouth is part of a ritual telling myself it's time to sleep."

13,105634,2022-06-14,Groggy but works,"Feels groggy and tired after waking up. Very easy to take this, gently press a couple of drops on the tongue and you'll be drifting off to dreamland soon. Love that it's 60ml, can last for a long time. "

22,105634,2023-05-11,,"Good quality company. The composition of the ingredients is good. I took a child with EPI and Autism, as there is a problem with falling asleep. Dosage: Half a pipette per 50 ml of water. There are improvements, falling asleep much faster. The taste is normal, valerian is felt. The child is 6 years old. I use before bed for 20 minutes"
23,105634,2024-01-29,sleep,Valerian has a strong smell and its effect is uncertain
24,105634,2024-07-28,,"After giving it to my child for a week, it didn't achieve the expected effect. The taste wasn't very good but it was acceptable."
25,105634,2024-05-23,notice,"During use, slight bitter taste for large doses..the ingredients seem to be of quality. Opinion divided on the benefit it should provide. Size of nickel packaging..may be necessary to increase the frequency of doses during the day in addition to those in the evening"
26,105634,2024-01-03,,"I'm taking it for the first time for my daughter. The composition is clean, the quality is good. one of the best brands on the site"

30,105634,2024-03-14,more like a sedative,"the quality is good, the smell is sharp, valerian, the little one didn't like the taste, he just doesn't want to drink it, it's very sweet and the smell is sweet. I add it to the water and nothing is heard there. doesn't want to sleep after it, but calms down a bit and that's good. I wanted the effect of a sleeping pill, but this is not it. "
31,105634,2024-03-01,,"Quality size packaging composition weight taste corresponds to the description. The supplement solves sleep problems well 
"

35,105634,2023-05-04,,"Until we see the result, we give the baby a year old, sleeps restlessly, the taste and smell are not the most pleasant, it is difficult to give the baby"

38,105634,2023-05-10,,"Did not like. Doesn't work like melatonin. I bought it only because melatonin in drops was not on the site. Must be taken several times a day. But in the composition there is valerian, which dulls the brain. Therefore, I do not give on an ongoing basis."
39,105634,2021-11-20,Super!,"Great size and handy pipette. The child sleeps well after a few drops before bedtime. The taste is pleasant, but the persistent smell of valerian."
40,105634,2023-08-05,,"valerian flavor. You have to mix it with water, but the effect is good. baby sleeps better. recommend."
41,105634,2022-08-31,,"Drops with a bright smell and taste of valerian, gave a one-year-old daughter to improve falling asleep and sleep, did not help as much as I would like. It all probably depends on the child. the review was useful for you, please like it üëç"

45,105634,2021-07-31,,"These drops have a strong classic valerian aroma, it is almost impossible for a child to disguise it (even in drinks such as cola)"
46,105634,2021-10-04,,"Very good quality product. Easy to use, effective, it has helped my 10 year old daughter."
