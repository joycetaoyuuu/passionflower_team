0,54199,2024-03-20,,"AOR products are always high in quality... the ortho sleep will let you relax and sleep in 15 minutes... most often it will give you relaxation sleep in meditative alpha level sometimes in dreamland, and you wake up refresh no hangover as other sleeping pills..."
1,54199,2024-01-02,,"Improved sleep quality: Many users report falling asleep faster, staying asleep longer, and experiencing deeper sleep with Ortho Sleep.
Reduced stress and anxiety: The calming properties of L-theanine and lemon balm may help ease tension and promote relaxation before bed.
Enhanced mood and cognitive function: Some users mention feeling more rested and focused throughout the day after using Ortho Sleep."
2,54199,2023-01-02,,Love this product! I no longer have trouble sleeping. I‚Äôm out within 20 mins of taking the supplement. I‚Äôve gotten other people hooked on it. I think it‚Äôs a great blend with 3mg of melatonin. All of the herbs work in harmony to help facilitate a deep sleep. 
3,54199,2023-09-30,Great Product!!!,"Have tried many natural sleeping tablets and I have found these to be the most effective for me. I take them 30mins before going to bed, which enables me to fall asleep in minutes.  Other sleeping tablets left me feeling groggy in the mornings but this brand doesn't for me. It is expensive but hey getting a good 7 hr to 8 hours sleep out weighs the cost in my opinion. I like this brand because it has the best combination of natural ingredients  that will guarantee a good night sleep.  If I'm feeling anxious I take 2 tablets but if I'm feeling ok I find that one is enough. "
4,54199,2023-09-09,Definitely helps to calm the monkey mind!,"This supplement has been part of my ""daily"" supplement routine for several years, and I plan to continue indefinitely. At bedtime, I take one of these AOR sleep pills, one 5mg melatonin pill, and half a tablet of N-acetyl cysteine. Like many working people in the world, I have a very busy life, and need to quiet my mind as I am trying to sleep. I have long observed that melatonin puts me into Delta sleep for longer, and my joints repair themselves better at night, but all of the additional ingredients in AOR sleep are definitely noticeable. One or more of the compounds has a ""stinkweed"" odor, but I don't really care! I am pleased with the research and formulation, and the price has been worth it to me. Good luck!"
5,54199,2024-06-23,Great,"This was thing is amazing, really helped me to sleep when I couldn‚Äôt "
6,54199,2024-05-19,Great!,"I had insomnia for so long, then this thing really helped me, highly recommended"
7,54199,2024-05-14,Great thing!,"It really makes me sleep, I had insomnia and couldn‚Äôt sleep and this thing worked! Highly recommended "
8,54199,2024-02-29,not for me,"I originally tried this because my acupuncturist recommended it for deeper sleep. It really seems to work for her. Unfortunately, it had the opposite effect on me. It actually kept me a awake and did nothing to help me sleep at all. AOR are normally great products. I've had some success with some of their other supplements. This one just wasn't for me. I have no doubt it will work for other people though."
9,54199,2023-06-02,,"This product is the best to help with insomnia, helps you fall asleep and re set your circadian rhythm, the ingredients are excellent quality and are a great combination of good amino acids, the size of the food capsules are small and easy to swallow "
10,54199,2023-03-03,Helped greatly ,I bought this for my GF who was having trouble sleeping at the time.   This help her greatly.  AOR puts out some quality products 
11,54199,2023-01-14,,"High-quality products
I bought a bottle and I m so happy.
I highly recommended!"
12,54199,2022-03-10,Really good,I find this salt to be a quality one and satisfying. My mom can't appreciate the difference from other salts but I sure can!
13,54199,2021-06-05,Aided in a good night sleep!,"Due to the pandemic, I had noticed that I was not sleeping well. I have been more anxious and have had a hard time letting go of negative thoughts. I found that when I take two capsules AOR Ortho Sleep, I fall into a deep sleep, and wake up feeling much more refreshed. I would highly recommend this product."
14,54199,2021-05-11,Most effective sleep remedy for me,"I discovered this (from a friend with hard core insomnia) in 2017 and continues to be my go-to sleep on weeknights, when I need it. It sometimes takes me an hour to fall asleep (if I look at screens before bed) but with OrthoSleep I can often stay asleep the whole night. I do not wake up groggy at all. I also like to remember my dreams (and write them down) and this does not seem to interfere with dreams."
15,54199,2016-12-20,Best Natural Sleep Aid,"These are by far the best and strongest sleeping aid i have tried. If you take one, within 20-30 mins you're fighting off the sleepiness. Never had an issue falling asleep when taking these. take 2 if you really need a good nights sleep but 1 is more than enough most of the time. "
16,54199,2022-04-26,,"have waited for this restock, i take 2 caps per night, feels like mild tranquilizer, makes me sleepy and have a deep restful sleep , mind feels alert next day.

something i noticed when i took these new stock, it made me more thirsty while i feel the drowsiness"
17,54199,2016-12-02,Probably the best natural product,"I have to take 2 caps and, even though the smell is quite harsh, they actually do help me get some sleep. 
It takes some 30 minutes with me, so plan well your evening and take the caps at the right time for best results. For me is just before getting ready for sleep (bathroom, cleaning teeth, washing face & removing make-up, moisturize, etc) so that I just have to set my alarm for the next day and I am almost asleep!"
18,54199,2022-09-24,,"AOR products are always high in quality... the ortho sleep will let you relax and sleep in 15 minutes... most often it will give you relaxation sleep in meditative alpha level sometimes in dreamland, and you wake up refresh no hangover as other sleeping pills... "
19,54199,2017-08-14,This product is helping after 4 days,I was using plain melatonin and still waking up at 3 or 4AM.   The ortho sleep gives a deeper and quieter sleep.  It has no after effects in the morning.  I recommend it highly
20,54199,2017-01-04,Great product,My doctor suggested I take these. I have taken two for three nights and they work beautifully for me. I fell asleep very quickly which is unusual for me. Tonight I will take one capsule to see how a smaller dose works. 
21,54199,2022-07-11,,Such a good product. Have been using it for years. Very grateful for it. 
22,54199,2022-04-20,–ù–µ—É–¥–æ–≤–ª–µ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ,"I am a fan of this brand.  Haven't had this sleep supplement for months.  When it appeared, I bought 2 cans at once ... and did not expect ... it looks like a fake.  Cheap label that peels off.  The smell is exclusively of valerian.  The new drug does not work like the previous one.  And I don‚Äôt understand whether the Canadian brand went down, or iHerb allowed fakes to be introduced ... Very disappointed ...."
23,54199,2022-03-17,Easy peasy,The pill is perfect for my boys. Easy to take and they don‚Äôt mind the flavor.
24,54199,2021-04-05,AOR ,"It really help me. I used to be up all night, only get 2-3 hrs of sleep, after a friend had recommended this Ortho sleep, I fall asleep very quickly."
25,54199,2019-03-01,Best natural sleeping aid available,"Works nicely, naturally inducing sleep in about 30 mins. They're natural so you still have to keep sleep hygiene - no blue light, no tv/comp/phone, cold sleeping room, heavy blankets,... They won't knock you out no matter what like medical drugs. Fortunately.

Could however include some magnesium bisglycinate (and B6 to process it) and double dosage of melatonin for 5-star effect."
26,54199,2020-04-13,Great product to make you fall asleep,It is the only one that makes me fall asleep and its melatonin content isn't that high. I highly recommend. 
27,54199,2017-01-07,Has No Affect.,"Note that I have severe insomnia and over the counter sleeping pills don't affect me. In fact, most drugs don't have effect and I have to double dose everything I take. Melatonin also does very little but I was hoping a combination of all these sleeping aids would work. They worked for a few days and then stopped. If you're resistant to medications like me and prone to insomnia these probably won't work."
28,54199,2016-06-16,Very good,"It makes me fall asleep quickly. Deep relaxed sleep, no bad dreams. The most effective sleep supplement i ever tried"
29,54199,2021-02-19,,"Amazing product - I'm so upset they've discontinued selling it here. I'm on my 3rd bottle and it's almost gone üò¢. I love that it's a multi vitamin as well as calcium, and I know I'm taking good care of my bones!"
30,54199,2021-02-25,,"It was fast delivery!
and very good product on good  price!"
31,54199,2015-01-17,Amazing product,I fall asleep within 15 mins... Highly effective !!!
32,54199,2017-09-19,Good product,This helped me sleep.  i take one in the AM and two at night before bed
33,54199,2020-11-07,,Absolutely sleep inducing!
34,54199,2019-01-21,No affect for sleep aid,"The product does not help me neither to fall asleep or just sleep: it gives me a heavy head feeling, that is all. Trying to return those pills and I do not recommend to buy it. "
35,54199,2021-04-26,,Helps me fall asleep
36,54199,2024-06-27,,"A comprehensive formula featuring the most powerful clinically tested natural ingredients available, including malatonin, GABA, valerian root and lemon balm extract. Promotes normal, restful sleep. high quality and safe ingredients. "
37,54199,2024-05-08,"Not for me, no effect.",I've been taking it for 1 month and no effect for me. The taste is not good. I'm always looking for the product that will help me sleep better!
38,54199,2023-05-06,,"Just a great drug. I love this company, amazing quality and efficiency. I recommend to all my friends. A very good composition, including melatonin, 5htp and a complex of herbs. I drink 20 minutes before bedtime, I slowly start to want to sleep. The effect is not like a regular sleeping pill, but softer. A very deep sleep, I have a great rest, in the morning there is no feeling of weakness, my head is fresh, it does not hurt. I will 100% order more. The ingredients are well chosen. The capsule size is not small, but I have no problem with that. The smell is quite strong herbal, but after swallowing there is no aftertaste in the mouth. I highly recommendüôå"
39,54199,2024-10-16,Super,A good supplement for improving sleep. I accept the doctor's recommendations. I don't wake up at night 
40,54199,2024-08-24,Excellent nutraceutical in doses and active ingredients.,"It performs its function through the synergy of the different active ingredients. For those with excessive dysautonomic activity, glycine and magnesium can be added."
41,54199,2024-08-11,,This is my favorite sleep aid product. Taking it before going to bed gives me a good night's sleep.
42,54199,2023-11-13,,"My favorite supplement for better sleep, excellent nonsense, I recommend it to anyone who has problems falling asleep!"
43,54199,2023-06-18,Very effective product to induce sleep.,"Orthosleep should be taken shortly before bedtime, with a dosage of one or two capsules. This product contains several good quality ingredients whose benefit is to allow you to fall asleep without difficulty. The pack size is perfect for one month."
44,54199,2024-09-07,Good addition,Good supplement Reliable manufacturer High-quality composition Good shelf life Helps with insomnia
45,54199,2022-10-21,,Bought for sleep. The composition contains melatonin in a good dosage. More than 3 mg is not needed.
46,54199,2023-04-12,,"The taste is not very good, the effect is good at the beginning, but the effect is not great after that, try another bottle and see"
47,54199,2023-04-18,,"It is only after a few days that the benefits appear. For me, the right dosage is to take 2 capsules"
48,54199,2021-09-19,Multi for sleep,"Contains all herbs and amino acids that are effective for sleep, including melatonin. The amount of melatonin is 3 mg, which is an appropriate amount to continue every day. If you have trouble falling asleep, please give it a try. I use this during times of stress and stress. Advanced Orthomolecular is a Canadian Doctors Trusted brand, so quality is also tested and it is pharmaceutical grade."
49,54199,2017-05-24,Good composition,"I buy for my mother (67 years) regularly, tried to buy separately melatonin in different dosages and forms, but eventually returned to this supplement. I tried to take 1 capsule, it does not help, and 2 pieces (as recommended) for 30 minutes before sleep help to fall asleep more quickly, this despite the fact that without additives it often does not sleep at all, or night through the night (in the daytime it never sleeps).
They do not guarantee a 100% result, if they are very nervous and not a fact that they will sleep 8 hours without waking up, but for now it is an additive and Dr. Mercola, Premium supplements, support sleep with melatonin are the most effective for her, we order constantly."
50,54199,2021-02-28,,"Great composition. A very good supplement. I fall asleep quickly, get up early in the morning, get up refreshed. The price is high, but worth it."
51,54199,2022-08-03,Excellent!,Everything was delivered quickly and the product is of excellent quality.
52,54199,2021-03-10,,"I bought it for my mother, I will repurchase it if it's good"
53,54199,2021-02-19,is acceptable,It's the most powerful of several products I have used
54,54199,2020-08-31,There is nothing wrong,"I took it from this company because it is well known, and I used it maybe 10 times, but the result is less than what I expected. According to the responses I read, it seems that the bodies differ."
55,54199,2022-01-23,Excellent!,very good top quality
56,54199,2019-12-10,Sleeping pills,"Sometimes my husband has two tablets for my sleepless husband, but we don't get any help from sleep supplements, so eating one of them is effective enough. I'm a bit stupid in the morning, but I don't have a headache."
57,54199,2022-09-09,,I don't know. will not repurchase
