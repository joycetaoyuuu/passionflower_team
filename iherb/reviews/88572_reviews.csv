This is one of those few! Of course no caffeine, but flavor is really quite nice with the blend of vanilla. It‚Äôs a nice relaxing cup to have right before bed. Tastes great, smells great, and works wonders. What more can I ask for? "
29,88572,2024-07-05,The spiced apple tasted a bit artificial to me,"Other than the artificial apple flavor (which may be to the liking of another), I think the product is fine. The cinnamon and vanilla flavor to it is soothing."
30,88572,2023-06-11,Tastes great!,"This stuff tastes amazing! I followed the directions I read online, and used milk instead of water. If you do it that way, and add a little honey it tastes like pie almost. I enjoyed the flavor. I just wish that ""bedtime"" tea didn't wake me up instead of helping me to sleep! Because this tea tastes awesome!"
31,88572,2023-03-26,,"Probably my favorite flavor. It keeps me calm before going to bed. The taste isn't too strong nor too weak, and is perfect for people who like apple cider (though in a softer version, which is perfect for me!).
The quality is really good, it is caffeine free, perfect to drink all day long - especially after meals or before going to sleep. I highly recommend!"

"
79,88572,2022-05-04,I LOVE this tea,"Love love LOVE this. This is a great quality amazing blend tea. I keep repurchasing it. Fragrance has strong notes of vanilla and spiced apple, the passionflower and chamomile are faint scents. Tastes like sweet apple/chamomile tea. Some might only like it in winter as it is more of a warm smell/taste tea, but i love it and use it throughout the year. So relaxing and soothing. I usually have a cup while watching TV before getting into bed. Each tea bag gives you one serving (1 cup) of tea, though it can be used again by pouring hot water though wont be as tasty or fragrant. Definitely recommend this."
80,88572,2024-03-13,Weak brew,"Bought it to hopefully help with sleep, the brew is a little weak though, but quite fragrant nevertheless."
81,88572,2023-06-23,Excellent!,I was looking for teas without caffein and this one suits the need. Delicate aroma with slight apple and cinamone frangrance. Can be used also for cold tea decanter to serve during the summer. As a fan of tea I am always looking for new ones. 
82,88572,2023-05-04,,"Apple and cinnamon is a magical combo for a winter time, however the scent of spices was kind of mild. the taste of passionflower was quite strong though. it's said to be rich in antioxidants. "
83,88572,2023-04-22,,"I like this tea. 
You can taste the chamomile, vanilla, and cinnamon, but the apples not so much. 
I don‚Äôt mind that as I love these ingredients. 
It is very enjoyable to unwind with. "
84,88572,2023-03-09,,"Twining is my favourite brand of quality tea. The size is just right even for first time buyers. I usually buy the cold-infuse line, this time I opted for one to be infused in hot water. One word, it smells & tastes amazing!"
85,88572,2022-04-15,,Excellent taste and aroma. 1 bag per mug is a good balance to create the result. Also tastes cold. Creates nice aroma mix with loose teas such as chamomile or ginger lemon. Add 2 bags for a can of 8-12 cups + the loose tea at 1 teaspoon per 2 cups.
86,88572,2022-01-30,"Aromatic, blended and lovely","I recently came across this product online and thought to take a chance and buy it. I am happy it paid off because this tea blend has no caffeine and is a perfect nighttime drink. The taste ranges from sweet from the passionflower and vanilla to a spiced apple flavour that is not over powering as it simply hints to warm apple. To me, each sip brings an array of the flavours that all seem to be distinct yet blend nicely. If you enjoy Twinings teas, this is simply another signature of their ability to blend some truly  lovely tea. I make one cup a night and I find that is filling and it helps me relax as I like to take in the aroma as well as it seems to help me unwind. "
87,88572,2022-09-26,Tastes a bit too artificial but pleasant in a way ,"I tried this and it‚Äôs fairly pleasant but it really has an artificial apple flavor added. So I stuck it in a storage box and forgot about it. Then I wanted chamomile tea to relax and found this. And I remembered why I put it away. If you don‚Äôt mind ‚Äúflavoring‚Äù (whatever that really is) as a dominant flavor, and clearly by its prevalence, many people love added ‚Äúflavoring‚Äù, then it‚Äôs a pleasant apple-y tea. I might drink it again if my sense of taste is diminished or feel sick, but not  a better one by them.  A matter of taste and it‚Äôs done well if you enjoy supermarket ‚Äúflavor‚Äù tea rather than a more natural tea.  "
88,88572,2022-02-23,Soothing and calming tea,"I drink this between after dinner and before bedtime, and I find it does help me to relax somewhat. I like the hint of chamomile and vanilla flavor - it's there but not over-powering."
89,88572,2021-12-25,,"Really wonderful tasting tea.. soothing and relaxing. I drink in after dinner and seems to help with digestion too. The only issue I see is some ingredient in it gives me a breakout on my arm or leg, very unusual. For that reason, I don't drink it very often, wish I did not get such a reaction. If not, its an awesome tea. "
90,88572,2021-11-23,Good for your daily life: Twings Unwind Herbal Tea,"This product is much better than expected. Its smell, taste, color and price are very satisfactory. It is good not only for serving before your sleeping time but also daytime serving. One of its ingredients, passion flower, may be a main reason for effectiveness. I really felt Twings supplies an amazing productg after enjoying it."

124,88572,2022-07-19,,"This tea is AMAZING! The notes of spiced apple and vanilla make me think of the winter holidays, warm and hopeful. I've only had it once so I can't speak to the sleep inducing qualities but it definitely has earned its spot on my repurchase list."
125,88572,2022-05-02,Excellent!  ,"I have trouble getting to sleep, often dozing for about 20 minutes then waking up.  This tea helps me relax so that I don't have that dozing period.  I go right to sleep.  The flavor is also great!  I love this tea!"
126,88572,2022-03-24,,"Based on the title I was not sure what kind of a flavour to expect exactly, but for me it definately tastes like Sweet (vanilla) apple tea. I like it and so did my kids!"
127,88572,2022-03-22,,"I just poured a cup before bed. Too soon to tell if it‚Äôs going to aid in helping me get to sleep but on taste alone, this is going to be a staple in my pantry. "
128,88572,2022-03-08,Spicy chamomile - yum!,"Love the twist of this chamomile tea. The blend of spices is delicious and it's a lovely caffeine-free tea with a lot of similar spices as chai tea, without the jitters.  Hope it comes back and is available again soon."
129,88572,2021-12-03,,"When I first smelled the tea package, I was unsure. But after I steeped it with hot water and tasted it. I was happy! It tasted wonderful with a hint of sweetness. Now I drink it every day! "
130,88572,2021-11-25,Good calming effect ,Somehow I am very drawn to the ‚Äúspiced‚Äù taste and really has a calming effect. I would also add some honey to enhanced the taste . Love it . 
131,88572,2021-11-17,,"The tea makes me sleepy every time I drink it, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend drinking it in the morning or during the day unless you are ready to take a sudden nap :D Overall, the tea is delicious, not too sweet but still savory. "
132,88572,2023-10-08,All time favorite tea,The smell is very unique and relaxing. I drink before going to bed. helps with sleep for sure 
133,88572,2023-05-19,,Tastes good. Can help to relax and make me sleep better
134,88572,2023-05-11,,"Delicious , soothing and relaxing, right blend of spices and I would purchase again "
135,88572,2023-01-19,Â•ΩÁöÑ,"Taste sweet and fresh. Quality is good.
I love the combination of the ingredients!"
136,88572,2023-01-04,,"The spiced and vanilla combination is great, never tried it before. However, the price can be a bit less expensive."
137,88572,2022-10-31,,A nice gentle tea blend ‚Äî way more simple in taste than it‚Äôs made out to be in the name. 
138,88572,2022-06-08,Â•ΩÁöÑ,"I have been drinking teas from twinings for years and they always taste good, this one is no exception, I enjoy this tea whenever I want to unwind. "
139,88572,2023-02-20,,Wouldn't buy this again - only cos I don't like camomile and tasted too much like camomile tea. Didn't enjoy the quality of this blend.
140,88572,2021-03-18,,I drank it once from my friend and immediately decided to buy it. Don't know why the price is a bit higher than other Twinings but after drinking you feel it so worthy. It's kind of perfect blend between apple pieces and vanilla. The good way to wind down your day and chill in the feeling of relaxed.
141,88572,2020-12-14,The best tea ,I am so sad this is out of stock. I think I‚Äôve ordered a total of 10 boxes by now. This is the only tea I drink in the evenings and this is the only website I can buy it from. Can‚Äôt wait for a restock! If you have the chance to try this tea - do it! 
142,88572,2023-04-11,,Good tasting tea. It didn‚Äôt really help with bloating though. 
143,88572,2023-02-20,,it‚Äôs okay but the taste of passionflower is stronger than apple
144,88572,2022-12-26,,Its good quality tea. The biggest benefit is the size of the packaging being individual sealed packets.
145,88572,2022-11-05,,Good quality and Nice i like it and will buy again later 
146,88572,2022-01-15,,Passionflower good for brain inflammation and camomile good for overall inflammation and works greatly against gut bacterias. A great combo.
147,88572,2022-10-09,,I like this flavour but not the best in comparison to the other twinings flavours. I expected this to feel more rich and full-bodied. The apple flavour is stronger than the vanilla. I liked the packaging as it keeps the tea bags fresh inside
148,88572,2022-08-25,,"Average bedtime tea, only wish the apple flavor can be stronger as I'm not a big fan of vanilla. Will probably just stick with tradition apple tea next time "
149,88572,2022-08-19,Special taste,"If you like it, it is good. If you dislike it, you can't stand as the taste is quite strong. A bit relaxing but it will not make you sleepy immediately. "
150,88572,2022-03-30,,I think the spices were  a little bit overwhelming but that‚Äôs personal taste I was looking for something a little mellower in taste. But overall good if you like spiced teas similar to chai.
151,88572,2021-02-17,Really nice evening tea,This tea is really nice to enjoy in the evenings and night time.  No caffeine either so no concerns about it affecting it sleep.  I find that it helps me to relax as I get ready for bed.
152,88572,2020-12-17,Great taste,"Great Apple, Cinnamon  & Vanilla taste! Even if passionflower usually does not taste that great, the unpleaseant note of it is not noticeble here. Great tea for wintertime and bedtime, but you can certainly use it all throughout the year!"
153,88572,2020-05-18,The best bedtime tea,"Lovely apple-vanilla with a hint of cinnamon flavor.  I find it great about 20 minutes before bed, it helps me relax and fall asleep more easily."
154,88572,2022-09-23,,This is really yummy! Great for fall and for any season actually!
155,88572,2022-06-22,,Tastes excellent for me! Drinking this instead of the regular caffeinated beverages in the morning. 
156,88572,2022-06-22,,Beautiful flavor and so relaxing. Perfect for before going to bed. 
157,88572,2022-06-16,,This tea has great quality. Very tasty and effective for good sleeping. With Twinings classic brand you can't go wrong 
158,88572,2022-06-13,Delicate tea for relaxing nights,"A delicate tea, a blend of apple and vanilla, with no caffeine. The package arrived in good condition and with a good serving size. "
159,88572,2022-06-04,,"Taste great and so effective.
I have a deep sleep with it."
160,88572,2022-05-26,,"Delicious tea, lovely aroma. It makes a wonderful before bedtime treat. Calming and soothing. Wonderful smell."
161,88572,2022-05-05,,"Great quality, nice taste / flavor, with a  slight vanilla aroma, all in all - nice herbal blend tea (non caffeine), was well packaged.  "
162,88572,2022-04-19,,Definitely helps me to relax before bed & get to sleep easily. 
163,88572,2022-03-15,,Passionflower always has a calming effect on me.  Great for sipping after a hectic day at the office.
164,88572,2022-03-03,,I have this tea before going to bed.I‚Äôm more relaxed & have a good sleep
165,88572,2022-03-02,,A nice cup of tea. Something about it is so simple and smooth that it really does unwind you... 
166,88572,2022-02-15,,"Really relaxing and the taste is super!
Caffeine free so it's nice to have before sleep."
167,88572,2021-12-13,,The floral combinations are so nice and effectively combined. I love how they mixed the flavors. I also love it being caffeine free
168,88572,2021-11-08,,The aroma is amazing great product for a good price
169,88572,2021-09-23,Lives up to its name,"I didn't fall in love with the taste when I first drank it, but somehow I did have better sleep the first few times I drank this, so now I actually look forward to drinking it when I feel tense and need to relax before bedtime."
170,88572,2021-05-28,Interesting combination of flavours,"Not really convinced it helped me to UNWIND, but the taste is quite unusual and worth to try. Not decided if I will buy again as it's a bit expensive and I still have other teas to finish first..."
171,88572,2021-02-02,Very nice tea,"The first cup - hated it. Second cup - hmm that's actually nice. Mostly tastes of cloves/cardamom, which I usually hate, but it works somehow in this tea. Really soothing and lovely. "
172,88572,2021-01-05,,"Very lovely fall/winter tea with crisp apple notes which are enveloped in warm spices and chamomile. But the flavor is very mild and rather soft, which is excellent for night time. "
173,88572,2020-12-05,,I finished this so fast I had it  every day at dinner time it tastes like ice cream and vanilla and I highly recommend it 
174,88572,2020-05-04,Nice relaxing tea for the evening,"Have been looking for a good passionflower tea to help sleep and glad to find Twinings introducing the Unwind. I personally dislike vanilla in tea in general, but Twinings makes it tolerable. A nice, relaxing tea for the evening."
175,88572,2020-02-01,So good,"This flavor is the best, but I can‚Äôt  find it  in any stores near me. Shipping fee was only $1 and got it within 2 days. "
176,88572,2019-11-22,So good,These are the best! I drink this half an hour before bed and i go off to sleep soon after. It is a great smelling tea. I will definitely continue to buy this product.
177,88572,2022-07-03,,Just sipping it after supper. Unwing is the right word after a family dinner.
178,88572,2022-05-29,,"My favourite brand of tea, buy their tea for many times.
"
179,88572,2022-02-09,,Perfect for those who suffer from difficulty of sleeping. Makes you feel calm
180,88572,2022-01-25,,It does make me feel relaxed .. I just have to get use to the taste ! It‚Äôs ok . 
181,88572,2021-11-11,,I like most of Twining's teas. Still this one is not of my favorites. 
182,88572,2021-10-25,,"Soothing, warming and nice taste. Not my favourite but still good quality"
183,88572,2021-06-25,,"This tea contains spices like cinnamon, cardamom and cloves that give it a strong flavor that sort of subdue the very mild flavor of chamomile. The taste is pleasant and gives me a kick, especially in the afternoon when I feel less energetic."
184,88572,2020-12-03,Lovely tea,"Great blend of flavors. I really like the taste and it's relaxing before bed. It's a little bit more expensive than the other teas i buy and as i get through tea so quickly, it wasn't good value for money for me."
185,88572,2022-06-08,,I like this brand most always but this a not my favorite blend.  Too much chamomile taste. 
186,88572,2022-01-20,,Not the best of the tea I like. Not so strong in favour 
187,88572,2022-01-15,,"It's ok, nothing amazing, smells nicer than it tastes."
188,88572,2021-07-16,Delicious!!!!,Such a relaxing delicious tea that tastes like warm apple crumble. So good - I add a spoon of honey but no real need either.

441,88572,2023-11-13,,It has a very delicious taste. It has cinnamon and vanilla. I liked the mix. It is drunk before bedtime. It is considered a soothing drink. Its quantity is large and it is caffeine-free.
442,88572,2023-08-30,,"The scent is so good. I always stock chamomile tea of some brand, but when I ran out, I found it while looking for it. I thought that the aroma and taste of adding cinnamon, vanilla and apple to chamomile would be wonderful. It was great. Great for relaxation and drinking before bed. I was sleeping when I was drinking, so I didn't know, but I haven't been able to sleep well lately, so I was wandering around looking for something and found this again. I'm worried about buying it again because the price increase is severe and it's not organic."
443,88572,2023-07-28,Nice,"Natural caffeine-free herbal tea, based on a mixture of plants and fruits, beautiful packaging of 18 tea bags individually packed to preserve freshness, packaging size 27 grams in total. The tea contains passionflower flowers which contribute to the quality of sleep, vanilla - which adds flavor and sweetness to the tea, and chamomile - which is also known for its properties to encourage sleep and relaxation at the end of the day. I didn't like the taste of the chamomile in tea less, I was hoping for a more pronounced taste of vanilla and apple, but the tea is delicious and of high quality, and I reserve it for guests who like a pronounced taste of chamomile in tea."
444,88572,2023-07-14,It has a soft fragrance,"I couldn't imagine what the flavor would be like just by looking at the letters, so I bought Twinings because I wanted to try a blend that wasn't sold in Japan. I feel that chamomile is dominant in the scent, but I feel that apple and vanilla are also present. I didn't know the spices and passionflower. I think it's a mild tasting tea. Glad I purchased the caffeine free. Depending on my physical condition, there are days when I don't like chamomile. I think it's about one cup, but I use a little more hot water. I felt that it was somewhat thicker with the same time and amount of hot water."
445,88572,2023-06-14,,The tea has a balanced flavor and a wonderful taste. It contains a mixture of spices and blended and wonderful flavours. It is a drink that tastes delicious and warm and smells good. Its benefit is important and excellent for health. The size of the package is suitable and the use is one envelope in the evening.
446,88572,2022-01-12,Great out! New!,"Favorite tea in a new design! And the taste is also a novelty! A little more expensive for the price, but not critical. Twinings tea is of very high quality, especially for tea bags. Fragrances are not at all intrusive and not chemical. Tea smells very pleasant and natural. I appreciate the absence of caffeine, because I can drink this tea in the evening and at night. Going on and on and on, testing different options ... Chamomile, spicy apple and vanilla are a wonderful winter scent! By taste, the apple comes out on top. And the manufacturer managed to convey this taste very similarly and naturally! Spices are also slightly felt, and their slight warming effect is present. In general, a delicious and aromatic composition came out. Together with gingerbread cookies, right under the tree, looking at the flashing lights of the garland, it is very cozy and meditative :)))"

477,88572,2022-09-27,Recommended if you don't like cinnamon,"A car with a little modification and feel. It tastes good in cold weather. It's not a taste that I use often because it contains cinnamon, but when I drink it hot, the vanilla and apple scent are subtle, so it's a strange taste that I drink it all. It is good to drink after a meal and prepare for bed."
478,88572,2022-09-23,,"You will be healed by the goodness of the scent. Since each tea pack is individually wrapped in aluminum, the scent does not escape, and it has a moisture-proof effect. I drink it at night before going to bed because the ingredients blended with passionflower and chamomile have a relaxing effect that relieves stress during the day. Occasionally, I mix honey-pickled lemons and dissolve gaba. Some people may find it easier to drink than chamomile tea. I thought I would be sure to buy it again, but unfortunately the yen has depreciated and the price is about 200 yen higher than when I bought it."

481,88572,2021-12-28,Awesome relaxing tea,"I took it crazy because it contains passionflower that helps to relax and rest, and with it chamomile, apple and vanilla, the taste is delicious, with a little sweetness of vanilla and apple, and the smell is crazy, a comfortable time, I felt a massage in my brain of relaxation worth the experience.. God does not make you happy if you benefit üëçüèª"

I‚Äôm trying to get away from this addiction, so I constantly try different varieties of teas, which will contain only herbs and no black tea at all. I didn't really like this tea - as for me, the apple is really spicy and interrupts the chamomile. I did not particularly notice the calming effect either. a good option to have this at work, to drink something at the computer without eating chocolates.

711,88572,2020-11-23,Together for honest reviews,"The flavor is literally as if you were drinking expanded apple cider vinegar flavored with vanilla ... !! This is my impression every time I try to accept this strange mixture .. Of course the taste is not bitter at all. Rather, adding dried apple flavor may be what gives you this unpleasant impression .. The flavor of vanilla and chamomile and the rest of the ingredients is very weak .. Just an experiment and I will not buy back .. Are you Do you agree with me? Hope you find interest in my review..ÿ±ÿßÿ¨ÿπ"
