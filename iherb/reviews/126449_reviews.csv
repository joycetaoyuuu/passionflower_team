0,126449,2024-05-25,very powerful,I've never tried this product before but this combination of herbs is know for sleep benefits.  I love this brand and wish it were alcohol free but let me tell you it works!  I only use 1/3 the dosage under the tongue and I fall asleep fast.  The challenge is that I wake up from some very vivid dreams.  I plan to take it and play around with the dosage so I can continue to get good sleep.  I like that it doesn't have valerian which tends to make me feel groggy and angry the next day.
1,126449,2023-10-27,Biodynamic Herbal Supplement,This is a super high quality product with organic and certified biodynamic ingredients. This is a strong herbal tonic. Please keep in mind that it will have a very strong flavor.  I still need to experiment more with it and see if it has good benefits. I trust this brand produces excellent products. 
2,126449,2023-12-14,Interesting but not for sleep,"I cannot attest to how this works for anxiety and the like, as I'd bought this for sleep and was curious to see how it affected the quality of my sleep plus how it impacted my dreams. Overall it definitely ramped-up the dreaming, but for sleep it did not help and had strange effects. I will stick with single herb tinctures like lemon balm or passionflower. "
3,126449,2024-01-25,Great!,Great product.  I like the ingredients and the concentration.  It's easy to take by itself and it works quickly.  Price is affordable.  Company is great too.
