In the century of technological development, our motor activity has decreased to a minimum. We get to work by transport, we go up to the apartment by elevator, we do not have hard physical work at home, because there are vacuum cleaners, washing machines and other benefits of civilization. In the evening, we don't go for a walk, but watch TV or ""surf"" on the Internet. And movement of the body is necessary, without it our well-being will not improve. Sometimes it's easier to go to the gym or fitness class than to force yourself to do something at home. Come on! Choose what you like and do it! Of course, it can be advised to get to work on foot and climb to the floor without using the elevator. But we are always in a hurry! The only way out is the gym and active recreation. Physical activity is a necessity for a healthy lifestyle"
