0,128567,2024-06-05,Works great! ,I love that brand. I bought other products from them in the past which were amazing. But the first night I tried this one I was skeptical cause I was so wide awake I thought there’s no way this was going to help me fall asleep in 30mn. Well it did! This brand is amazing and so efficient. So glad I found it.
