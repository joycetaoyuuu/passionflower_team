0,51408,2024-02-02,Great!,"Passionflower capsules offered a gentle calming effect during stressful periods. I appreciated the natural approach and found them moderately helpful in unwinding. However, the effects were subtle, and it took some trial and error to find the right dosage for me. Additionally, the capsules are quite large, which some might find difficult to swallow. Overall, a decent option for mild stress relief, but manage expectations and be patient with finding your personal sweet spot."

105,51408,2017-04-11,PassionFlora - from insomnia and for the peace of the nervous system,"Scientists believe that passionflower increases the level of a chemical substance called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA reduces the activity of certain brain cells, contributing to relaxation. Chemicals in passionflower soothe, cause sleep and reduce muscle spasm. There is some evidence that passionflow can reduce anxiety symptoms, sometimes as effectively as some medications. Passionflow enhances the effect of sedatives.
Contraindications: pregnancy and feeding. In other cases, passionflower is considered safe and non-toxic, provided that the recommended dosage and course duration is not more than 2 months. Cautions: Passion flora promotes blood thinning, so people taking appropriate medications should be careful and consult a doctor. Passion flower can affect the central nervous system. This can increase the effect of anesthesia and other medications on the brain during and after surgery. Stop taking passionflower at least 2 weeks before the planned operation. ***** Before buying this particular dietary supplements I was already familiar with the excellent effect of passionflowers for insomnia and anxiety. This passionflower helped me uniquely. Without her, I could not sleep until morning. And now I do not fall asleep at once, but still fall asleep. It also has a soothing effect. I react to everything calmly and do not get nervous). I drink it 1 or sometimes 2 capsules half an hour before bedtime. There are no side effects, it is transferred well. ***** To read more of my reviews go to my profile (for this click on my name at the top of the review).
