9,121027,2023-11-17,The quality is perfect,"Dose - 3 jelly candies in the evening, I recommend before going to bed. The advantage is fast action, I take it 30 minutes before bedtime, after 2-3 days sleep normalizes. The taste is a lemon aftertaste, and such organic herbs, a little astringency remains on the tongue. The size is small jelly candies. The ingredient is herbs to relax the nervous system and improve it. I recommend you try it, take at least 2 jars at once, since they are rarely available and in small quantities, and they run out very quickly."
