Within a few weeks, she noticed a significant reduction in muscle pain and fatigue. She finds it very soothing and says it allows her to sleep better at night. As someone who's tried many fibromyalgia treatments, she's thankful to have found something natural like this that improves her condition. It's been very helpful for her. "
