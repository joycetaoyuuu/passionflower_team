2,126451,2024-04-07,Very effective ,"Valerian of excellent quality. Since it is in a liquid, it works very quickly. I drip before going to bed as indicated on the bottle - I sleep like a child, although I have been living in Kyiv in constant stress and anxiety for 2 years. The only thing is that it is not clear why it says vanilla and lavender - it only smells like valerian and that's all. The taste is herbal. If the feedback was helpful, please click Yes. "
