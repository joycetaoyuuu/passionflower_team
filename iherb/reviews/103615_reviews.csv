0,103615,2024-09-29,Anxious 11 Year Old,"My daughter gets very anxious about going to school, once she is there she is fine, however the lead up to school of an evening or in the morning can be traumatic.

She gets herself worked up and in a state of panic that she cannot control and all she wants is her safe space which is to be at home and be with us.

We started using these after reading the reviews of how it‚Äôs helped calm other children and I have to say it‚Äôs helping my child. She has noticed a difference and so have we since taking these, she feels calmer and more in control or able to handle her anxiety better.

We also found even though they are chewable we try and get her to suck them slowly on the way to school as another way to occupy her and getting her mind off wondering and getting anxious.

Great quality product and tastes good, and seems to be helping, have ordered a few bottles as taking two a day you can get through them pretty quickly.

1,103615,2024-07-13,Excellent ,"I bought it for my 10 yrs old son. He sometimes gets anxious and angry and I thought this one could help him to calm down. I noticed a nice change in his behavior after taking them‚Ä¶ I believe these gummies are really helping as I‚Äôve tried to take them for myself as well when I was nervous to calm down‚Ä¶. They taste like grape juice gummies, very sweet.

2,103615,2024-07-08,Good supplement for kids,We're using this to help maintain focus at school and so far we like the results. I give my older son one in the morning and all kids one at night to help with sleep. We've noticed it has helped them fall asleep faster. The actual gummies are kind of large and leave a chalky feeling in your mouth but they haven't complained. The flavor is great and they ask to take them. The quality is perfect. Highly recommended. 
3,103615,2024-07-02,,"So far this seems to be the most ideal mixture of supplement composition, great quality. I give 2 gummies to my 14-year-old after dinner.  My child seems to be calmer and in better mood since he started on this. Note the gummy size is quite big so do take care when chewing and sucking especially for smaller children will recommend cutting into 2."

7,103615,2024-05-26,A little more focused,I bought these for my daughter as I am personally opposed to giving 'meds' to kids if not absolutely necessary and prefer to try nature first always. my daughter (mildly adhd) is reporting that she's able to focus better at school. Wears off after about 6 hours but just good enough to get through her classes less 'busy'. No side effects and a pleasant flavour. this is on my monthly grocery list

85,103615,2023-12-16,Much better than others,My son likes these. I had a chewable tablet in this type of supplement before and he didn‚Äôt like it at all. He will happily take these. We are about 3 weeks in. I do feel like he is doing well with it. 
86,103615,2023-12-10,Great calmer,"I have a 10 Yr old who suffers from anxiety attacks and BIG emotions. We're 1 1/2 bottles in, and he's 70% calmer and his sleep has definitely improved.
He takes 2 a day."
87,103615,2023-12-10,,"Thank you very much for this product, it suited me, I like the packaging, comfortable and stylish, I will order more of these products, and recommend them to all my friends and relatives! good!!
"
88,103615,2023-11-08,One of the best product,"One of the best products we use in the morning. It would be lucky if this one also had 5-htp, then you don't need to take it separately."
89,103615,2023-11-06,Great for relaxing before sleep,These are my favourite for any kids that tend to be overactive before sleep.  Nice for winding down and I use them after our last meal before bed. Great quality product and I like that they taste great too!
90,103615,2023-10-29,Really helping my son,I purchased these for my son who is having an anxious time. He has one of these every morning before school. Good clean ingredients. Will continue using 
91,103615,2023-10-29,Nature's Way Cool Calm and Collected,These calming gummies have always been our go to for helping my kiddo take the edge off when needed. They seem to be great quality and my kiddo appreciates the taste so it's a win-win. We use fairly frequently to help ease her stress/anxiety.
92,103615,2023-08-31,Great for ADHD /ODD child,"I bought the Cool, Calm and Collected gummies for my ADHD /ODD child. I give one gummie in the morning with his regular ADHD meds and one in the afternoon when the meds start to wear off to help with irritability and it has actually made a difference. I plan on ordering more. I would definitely recommend for behavioural issues, irritability and aggression, it helps calm my son without making him a zombie. It just helps him be less impulsive, more patient and less irritable without taking away his personality. Also, I thought the smell wasn‚Äôt great but my son loves the taste and has no problem with them üòã Great product! üòä"
93,103615,2024-08-06,Didn‚Äôt notice a difference en behaviour. ,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for fussy kids. 

My daughter hates the taste I did force her to try for a week, but didn‚Äôt notice any change in her mood.  I am not sure if you need to be on them for a while to see results but I couldn‚Äôt convince her to continue them. "
94,103615,2024-07-22,Taste needs work,"Gave these to my two neurodivergent kids and they absolutely hated the taste, sadly. It was hard to tell how good the effect was because I couldn‚Äôt get them to take them consistently. Good ingredients so I hope they work on the flavoring a little or maybe release a different flavor. "
95,103615,2023-10-31,It is ok,"Not as good as other brand i tried. Doesn't really keep my active 10 years old calm or focus for long. Works maybe for an hour and after he is back to being not focused and not calm lol
Another brand is working better so i will stick with the other one. gave 3 stars because it works a little.
Another problem is that my boy complained that it was too sugary which surprised me because he likes sweet stuff but found these too sweet. "
96,103615,2024-04-28,Taste just like grape hubba bubba ,These are a great gummy just a shame my child won‚Äôt eat them because of the taste. I tried one and they taste like grape hubba bubba bubble gum.  
97,103615,2024-10-16,My daughter didn't like the taste!,"Looks lovely, great bottle and well presented. But my daughter didn't like the taste so now they are going in the bin.

I guess the only way to know is to try!
 "
98,103615,2024-10-07,Pleasant taste and I think it helps my son calm down. ,Taste is pleasant enough that he‚Äôs happy to have it every day without any issue and I find he calms better when having it regularly. 
99,103615,2024-08-30,Can‚Äôt tell yet. ,Got this for my 8 year old son who has ADHD.  He likes the taste but I‚Äôm not sure if I see a great impact. The gummies are tend to stick to each other. 
100,103615,2024-08-09,Kids calming gummies,They smell very strong but taste ok. They are good quality and I use these when I need to take my daughter out for the day and she is feelings anxious. 
101,103615,2024-07-24,Good product,"Good product but not sure how many my kid can intake. He is 11, so should he take 2 at a time day and evening or 2 in total per day. 
Special in taste but easy to chew. 
We will try them again when School starts.. "
102,103615,2024-07-23,Not bad,"Not bad but will likely wait to order again
Only one kid is eligible to use it and the younger one actually needs it more
I found a different one with similar ingredients more age appropriate "
103,103615,2024-07-09,They work okay,"I notice some benefit in calmness and ease at bed time with my 9 year old.  Takes the edge off, sometimes more than others.  Perhaps if he's eaten recently, not as much as when given on an empty stomach. "
104,103615,2024-06-19,Trying them now ,"Child has just turned 8, so just starting to use them now. Quality is great, child likes them. Only need to take 1 a day, so bottle doesnt run out too quickly."
105,103615,2024-04-03,"good taste, but light effect on children",the product has a good taste and is easy to take but i am not sure if it has any effect on calming my child
106,103615,2024-03-02,Taste good and maybe help?,I can‚Äôt be sure how much these actually help but they taste good and my kids has no objections to taking them with other gummy vits. 
107,103615,2024-02-16,"Cool, calm and collected","I use these in my 5.5yo who has horrible meltdowns, anger etc. we are 3 weeks into them and I have definitely seen a lower amount of breakdowns from her."
108,103615,2023-12-27,Son loves them,"My son loves these, I am not sure if they make any difference in his behavior. But my son loves the flavor , I give him one if he seems more stressed than normal and I havnt seen a difference but he likes to eat them. "
109,103615,2023-11-26,Okay,"My son likes taking these, but I'm not sure if there's been a massive difference in him since starting on them about a month ago."
110,103615,2024-03-13,Works best,The quality is just amazing! My kid is using it for awhile and seems to be great! 
111,103615,2023-07-23,,"My son have a problem with managing his emotions and anxiety, so I had hard time with his behavior as well. He was not able to stay at school normally, but since we start taking this supplement his mood changed. He start to be more calmer and focused. I will repeat it."
112,103615,2023-07-16,,‚ÄèThe best product good package for all age the ingredient very well the quality is good taste sweet no harmful for diet there is a lot of benefit you have to have it as supplement and if you concern haw long it can serve composition and the improvement for hemp I see the good behavior 
113,103615,2023-07-04,,"I purchased these calm gummies for my sons, and while the taste is enjoyable, they were not fond of the texture. Despite this, I appreciate the calming effect they provide. If your child doesn't mind the texture, these gummies could be an effective and tasty way to promote relaxation."
114,103615,2023-06-22,,"We are getting accessed for ADHD, & since our teacher mentioned more about ADHD & using this product it has shown that my child can be calmed better and is a lot calmer throughout the day, we notice a big difference we do only use a half on weekends & use a whole when he goes to school to give more effect and have a lot better behaviour "
115,103615,2023-06-04,,"I cannot say enough good things about these gummies. My son was suffering from anxiety to a point that was making us all crazy - emotional outbursts, tons of tics, etc. I did some research and decided to try these and he has literally been a new kid since taking them. He‚Äôs been so much more balanced, sweet and calm and NO TICS. I was trying everything else and nothing was working.  I‚Äôm just sad I didn‚Äôt know about these sooner. "
116,103615,2023-05-02,It has made a slight difference,"These have made a noticeable difference to my son's mental health and associated behaviors.  We believe he may have ADHD, but until an assessment is undertaken, it cannot be confirmed. However, these gummies seem to help him to manage a little better and that to me is better than nothing"
117,103615,2023-02-07,,I have been looking for magnesium supplement for my son who is on Ritalin. I like these because it is in gummy form so it‚Äôs convenient as opposed to powder form. It is an acquired taste. My son didn‚Äôt really like the taste at the start but he is used to it now. We take one in the morning and one at night. He is 10yo. We have ordered again. Some gummies have stuck together but it‚Äôs easy to separate. All good. Will keep buying as long as my son is happy to take them.
118,103615,2023-01-19,,"Wonderful sweets. I got ( 11 years old ) for my daughter, but, frankly, I myself eat them with pleasure, especially when there is a day full of events and emotions. They really give peace ( and sometimes it is so necessary for our mothers to perceive the tricks of children üòä without unnecessary worries. I see that my daughter has become more focused and less worried about school. I plan to order more!  "
119,103615,2022-11-18,,"Too soon to say for sure, but after a week I feel like I see improvement in my son‚Äôs behavior. He appears to be more calm and has been able to monitor and manage his emotional response to certain situations. We‚Äôve seen far less tears and breakdowns this past week. Not gonna lie, as an overworked and overwhelmed full time working parent of four kids, I am tempted to try it myself üòÇ. "
120,103615,2022-11-15,,"These gummies taste fantastic and work wonders. Children are calmer, and fall asleep faster after lights out. Great quality ingredients, I used it myself to test it out. My children used to take hours to fall asleep and often wake during the night. Not anymore! I love the calm quietness when they're peacfully sleeping. Will definitely be ordering more."
121,103615,2024-09-06,adhd gummies,"works well, good substitute or option if you don't want your kid on medicine, I chose to go the natural way, but every kid is diffrent ! my kid started taking them under 8 with omega 3 and melatonin to fall asleep. "
122,103615,2024-05-22,Taste is good,My son tried these a few times. He likes the taste of them but they don't really help him much. Taste and texture and good.
123,103615,2024-04-09,Brilliant ,"I purchased 2 bottles for my 9year old son and we are just coming to the end of them. I can see a difference in him, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be having angry outbursts. I am going to be purchasing again. "
124,103615,2023-10-05,Sleep ,I gave it to my child in the evening so that he can sleep throughout the night. It helped him sleep quicker and less waking up at night. The difference is he‚Äôs sleep is more calmer when taking this supplement than not taking it. I tried it too and my sleep is much rested.
125,103615,2023-07-14,Kid rated A+,My child has anxiety and she really likes these gummies. She is 13 years old and has found these to be very helpful for situational anxiety and panic. She usually only needs one to feel the effect. I like that it uses all-natural ingredients. I have tried these as well and found them to be very calming with no activation or side effects.
126,103615,2023-06-20,,"Our son has severe anxiety, and we have introduced this into our night time routine, and it has helped greatly. We find he has a more restful sleep, and it does help speed up how long it takes for us to get him settled at night (Note: we also give him star of Bethlehem at dinner time)."

132,103615,2022-11-12,Helpful,"Was recommended to use vitamin B to help my son's regulation and mood due to medication he was taking. I saw this product and other reviews and decided to try it. My son has ASD, non-verbal and can be very irritable due to seizure medication. It took around 2 weeks, but I've seen his old ways returning. He's noticeably happier and calmer which is wonderful."

282,103615,2023-04-07,,I‚Äôve started taking these as an adult! I chew 2 daily and am finding that it is helping me to remain calm and collective.
283,103615,2023-03-29,,I can really see a difference in my son's mood. He is usually either very low or very high but there seems to be a bit of a balance between these extremes and I'm hoping it progresses further. 
284,103615,2023-03-20,,Very helpful for calming my 9 year old. She uses these first thing in the morning to get the day off to a good start. Quality ingredients.
285,103615,2023-03-16,,"It's been a week of giving it to my children and it's too early to say that it is working. My boys like the taste of it, I give them before sleep as a treat. "

"
290,103615,2022-12-09,,We used it only briefly for my 7 year old son when he changes school to help him through the stressful transition. Not a huge difference but worked a little. 
291,103615,2022-11-25,,"can see a visible improvement in my 6 year old son, he is more calm less outbursts and anger issues, will take atleast a couplenof weeks for effect to set it"
292,103615,2022-11-21,,Taste is ok but I find them really useful when my 9 year old has a challenging day ahead and it‚Äôs helped him stay calm 
293,103615,2024-09-15,Jury is still out,"I think these made my 8 year old sleepy and loss of energy! I was hoping it was going to help with some school related overwhelm she was having around Maths, but it seemed to just really dull her out for a few hours. Might try again but unsure!"
294,103615,2024-04-19,"Flavour good, effect zero","Unfortunately Natures Way, Cool Calm and Collected has had no noticeable results with our child, she does enjoy the taste, they smell good and requests one each evening however we‚Äôve seen no relaxing or calming effects üòä  after using for 3 weeks. "
295,103615,2024-01-23,Very disappointed ,"Very disappointed, i had really high hopes for these after reading all the comments. My daughter has ADHD & autism, but they didnt help to calm her down, she was having them twice a day but saw no change in her behaviour."
296,103615,2023-12-12,Not much change,I have a dual diagnosed child ADHD and AUTISTIC didn‚Äôt see much change in her doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt work just wasn‚Äôt affective for her 
297,103615,2023-03-05,"Nature's Way, Kids, Cool, Calm & Collected, Ages 8 +, Grape , 40 Gummies","I recently tried Nature's Way Kids Cool, Calm & Collected gummies and I have to say I'm impressed! These gummies are designed to help promote a sense of calm and relaxation in children ages 8 and up.

The grape flavor is delicious and not too overpowering. It's a great alternative to traditional capsules or tablets that some kids may have difficulty swallowing.

I appreciate that these gummies are made with natural ingredients, including L-Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea that is known for its calming properties. They also contain magnesium, which is essential for relaxation and healthy sleep patterns.

I've noticed that my child is more relaxed after taking these gummies, especially before bedtime. They don't make her feel drowsy or groggy, but rather help her wind down and get ready for a restful night's sleep.

Overall, I highly recommend Nature's Way Kids Cool, Calm & Collected gummies for parents looking for a natural and effective way to support their child's relaxation and sleep."
298,103615,2023-01-07,,"My son has been taking the gummies for 2 weeks now. We have noticed a difference in his mood and behavior.  He has not had nearly as many anger outbursts or frustrated episodes. I would absolutely recommend the cool, calm, and collect gummies for children who need help regulating their behaviors. "
299,103615,2022-11-03,,"Brought these for my 10 year old son, he‚Äôs been on them around a week now, it‚Äôs too early to say for sure how good they are working for him but this week in school he received a certificate for good work and respectfulness of the classroom. Maybe coincidence but he will continue to take them for sure. Easy to use and quality is excellent "
300,103615,2022-05-19,,I bought this hopes that it would help my son with his tics.  He has mild tourette syndrome and we'll as ADHD and it has helped incredibly.  I even got messages from his teachers telling me the difference they've noticed in him recently!! Yay!! Highly recommended for sure! 
301,103615,2022-05-13,Excellent for Anxious Kids,I've had great success with these for my child who is a bit prone to anxiety. These have zero side effects on my kid and are totally safe to use at least on my child. They work well to take the edge off of any anxiety and my kid likes the taste of the gummy. I have repurchased this a few times and will continue to do so. Fabulous product!
302,103615,2022-05-10,,"Gummies are with a pronounced smell, the childs likes. My son  -  9 yo was worried about school, and we resorted to the gummies.I can say that he is now much calmer, organized and successful in school.
I have also added Omega 3 to him diet. I give it to him every morning before school."
303,103615,2022-04-21,,"This product has clean ingredients and is vegetarian! I was looking for something to aid my 10-year-old son in emotional regulation. This is exactly was I was looking for. While there still is the occasional blowback when he has to do math homework (who wouldn‚Äôt fight it?!), he has been able to control more impulsive feelings. The quality of the packaging was good and product arrived quickly with no damage. You are able to use this product once or twice a day depending on needs. Taking it at night helps with sleep so one in the morning and night is best. "
304,103615,2022-03-09,,"I bought these for our kids and they love the taste. (I tried them and the taste seems alright but I seem to be missing the appeal.) These include both magnesium and vitamin B6, which is a combination that has actually had some studies done on reducing stress and nervousness, so having this combination available in a gummy is perfect. I give the kids one in the morning and one in the evening, so we go through them pretty fast."
305,103615,2024-10-05,,I was hoping it would help but it was ok in the long run 
306,103615,2024-08-20,works ok but bad taste,my 9 yr old hates the taste. I'd have to force these and she didn't like them. but they did work
307,103615,2024-07-05,,Flavour is good but I didn't see noticeable changes.
308,103615,2024-06-19,not too sure,My kid has occasional anxity. It worked on the first time but not in second time. I think it is all about psychological side
309,103615,2024-05-26,Not wonderful ,"My daughter doesn‚Äôt like the taste, seems to work with calmness but also makes her tired. So not great for daytime "
310,103615,2024-05-08,,"This was good. Not great, not bad. I like Nature‚Äôs Way though. "
311,103615,2024-05-02,Great quality but taste was not there ,Nice compact gunny without a sugary coating. Good quality ingredients. Wish it tasted better. 
312,103615,2024-03-30,,Good easy to swallow take time to used to it
313,103615,2024-01-10,No Obvious Change,"My child does like the taste and enjoys his ‚Äúbedtime gummy‚Äù, but he does not sleep well, nor is he calmer after having one."
314,103615,2024-01-09,"Good product,","but with my 8.5 son every morning is a struggle, he doesn‚Äôt like the taste"
315,103615,2023-10-28,Kiddo likes the taste,"Typical of supplements however i dont think.its doing much of anything.  He seems just as anxious as ever

"
316,103615,2023-10-15,Bedtime ,"Still new to this product but have been giving it to my 6 year old before bed, he enjoys the taste which is half the battle! Looking forward to seeing how it works in a few weeks!"
317,103615,2023-09-30,,Good for kid we begun to use it some days ago so cannot say result but I give it in the evening and my baby sleep faster then before
318,103615,2023-09-21,Take a while to eat ,"Not sure if they work , teacher said she sees a slight difference, my son is picky and said it doesn‚Äôt taste bad but takes forever to eat "
319,103615,2023-09-03,,"So far, so good. We haven't used these for long and time will tell.  Our child is happy eating these, enjoys  the taste, and says they help them feel calmer. "
320,103615,2023-08-19,,I feel these gummies have helped my son with his behaviour and calm him somewhat. It is hard to be consistent with him taking them as he dose not like the taste. 
321,103615,2023-06-20,,not sure if they assist my sons adhd / asd traits but they have a reasonably good taste. behaviour may have improved but not certain  of the link as yet. may assist with child's anxiety 
322,103615,2023-04-19,,excellent ! Bought this for a friends child who is hyper active ...after taking it for a month he saw more focus on his child while studying 
323,103615,2023-04-17,,"My 10 year old loooves the test, i did not notice a lot of change in him, but it is  expensive, can not continue taking it for long time."
324,103615,2022-11-14,,"My kiddo doesn't mind the taste, so that's a win. I'm not sure how much they help with him feeling anxious, but we're going to keep taking them for a while and hope for the best!"
325,103615,2022-10-09,Not sure if its works but its a great placebo if not,My kid asks for these now. We tell him it stops him having nightmares or he will want one if he's in the middle of an autistic meltdown. Im not sure they are doing anything but we keep buying them because he thinks they work so that is worth it for us alone. They may well work though as i know the ingredients are things i find benifical but they are in much much lower doses. 
326,103615,2022-09-27,,"Our 11 year old son had such a difficult time with his anxiety. We wanted to find a natural supplement that would help him. He takes two gummies everyday and we have noticed a drastic difference in his behavior. Cool, Calm, and Collected lives up to it's title. We will continue to order this product."
327,103615,2021-11-18,Good purchase,"I was looking for something to calm my son's mood (he's 7) and found these.  Not only are they very juicy and tasty  they do actually provide some relief.  He really enjoys eating them as its like having a real treat,  which can be half the battle (tried omega 3 oil once , fish flavoured banana syrup???). Good product. "
328,103615,2022-06-10,,I give that star though to taste and quality. i have not noticed the calmness after 2 weeks regular intake. overall my son loves it.
329,103615,2022-06-06,amazing product,these work so well for my daughter! she had the worst anxiety and after taking these for a few weeks you could tell that she had massively settled. great product would highly recommend 
330,103615,2022-05-20,,"Bought the first bottle to try improve my son so can sit calmly at school, so far no any sign of improvement. I think it's too big, need supervision on kids to chew it. "
331,103615,2023-01-31,,"My 10-year-old tried these gummies and had the worst day he's ever had at school. Firstly, they made him very tired and then extremely emotional - he was definitely not cool, calm or collected! I actually tried one to see what they were like and I had to lie down because I was so tired. "
332,103615,2022-11-20,,I was really hopeful this supplement would help my daughter but after 4 days of taking it she developed muscle spasms and twitching due to an excess of Vitamin B6. The vitamin B6 level is 6x over the daily recommended dose. I think this would have the possibility of being a great product if they lowered the amount of B6. 
333,103615,2022-10-25,,My son really enjoyed them and seems like these work. We are now ordering a second bottle 
334,103615,2023-09-14,,"Good quality of product, great scent , good texture and package . Hope it will useful and show some improvement. Happy to have it one after this as backup since fit size. Thanks iherb to provide benefit item to consumer. Tq"
335,103615,2023-07-31,Look good ,"Unfortunately for us, we can't give a full honest review since my son finds the gummies large and even when cut in half he's still put off the taste but that's just him.

Stopped using as he won't take them which is unfortunate."
336,103615,2023-01-15,Did not work as expected,Was hoping this would help my son fall asleep faster but that did not happen. 1 mg of Melatonin works much better. He liked the taste of the gummy. Won't buy again.
337,103615,2022-11-03,,This stuff has been awesome for my 8 year old that was having some focus issues in class. I did have to give it to him at night bc it would make him so sleepy during the day.  We wont go a day without it.
338,103615,2022-10-23,,These are good quality and taste great! My son seemed to like them and I believed they did help him to settle down and focus.  I used these on days that he was extra moody to help him calm down.  The ingredients were good and all effective.

412,103615,2022-09-20,,"I have no idea whether or not this is an effective product (or what the quality is) because my son could not stand the flavor - he felt it was too gritty and sour.   I was hoping to use this to help my son who struggles with ADHD, but won't know, as he couldn't handle the flavor -- shame, because it had great reviews and is a good price."
413,103615,2022-08-25,My kid does not like the taste,"I bought this for my kid to help him calming down at evenings. He does not like the taste, so he can not take this product. I started taking it myself - just so it would not end in the trash. As an adult I think I do sleep rather well after taking them - and have no side effects."
414,103615,2022-07-04,,My son tried one of these and didnt enjoy the flavour at all. I will work with him though and try at other times as he has done the same with other vitamins in the past and then gone on to take them ok. I love the idea of the product and how they can support him though. 
415,103615,2024-09-08,Didnt like ,My daughter didn‚Äôt like the texture or taste. She won‚Äôt take them. 
416,103615,2024-06-11,dont help,I gave this to my child and he behaved even worse than before 
417,103615,2024-05-11,,This didn‚Äôt help my child who has adhd and anxiety

419,103615,2024-05-03,Does not work,This item does not work at all.  Was giving to my daughter for 2 weeks now and I don't see any difference. 
420,103615,2024-03-30,not kosher friendly,i dont like that this has grape flavor. it's not kosher friendly. any other flavor would have been fine but grape
421,103615,2024-03-02,great taste,kids loved the taste but made no difference in calming them
422,103615,2024-02-21,not for me,don't know about the quality but when I took I became anxious and very restless.
423,103615,2024-01-27,Does nothing,doesn't do anything for my son with adhd expect make him bounce more. 
424,103615,2024-01-01,Didn‚Äôt notice ,Didn‚Äôt notice a difference when taking these. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.

426,103615,2023-12-16,Didn‚Äôt do anything ,I didn‚Äôt really notice any effect after using these. 
427,103615,2021-02-11,Interesting But Not Effective,"I would consider giving these 3 stars as they haven't been effective on our two kids. They only take 1 but with all that is going on, they still have meltdowns and other issues during the day. Like the combination of calming ingredients that are included in this. Has a strong grape taste but these are no gummies - more like a grape jellybean in texture. They're not small, so if giving them to a younger child consider first cutting it up before giving it to them!"
428,103615,2023-07-24,,"work well, my daughter is not a fan of the taste, but she is picky and she eats them no issues. 
we will definitely keep using. "
429,103615,2023-04-14,,nice to take my kid likes it very much after taking it for a week I can see som improvent in my son ' s hyper active behavior lesser 
430,103615,2022-10-16,,"My son takes this before bedtime to help him whine down and fall asleep quicker. Flavor is good, although drink with a little water since the gummy consistency is a little thick. Would definitely recommend and buy again."
431,103615,2022-09-10,,"My little brother loves the taste of these gummies so much, he likes the product in general, according to my observation this brand  genuinely and effectively  calms his mood."
432,103615,2022-08-14,,"Great delivery, arrived before expected delivery date. The product seems to be good although we haven‚Äôt been using it long but so far so good. My daughter is happy with the taste of the gummies, overall good quality. Thank you "
433,103615,2022-07-04,,Love these for my kids! The prefer the taste of these over others we have tried before and i can tell the help my boys with focus!
434,103615,2022-06-18,,"Good quality of product, great scent , good texture and package . Hope it will useful and show some improvement. Happy to have it one after this as backup since fit size. Thanks iherb to provide benefit item to consumer. Tq"

436,103615,2022-05-02,,My son takes one gummy a day. I haven't seen any changes in him yet but we've only started a week ago. I like the ingredients blend and it's a great supplement to give in any case. It will work for some and less for others. 
437,103615,2023-09-11,Expensive but works!,Great to keep my hyperactive kids calm and I notice the difference when they have it in the morning and also before they sleep. 
438,103615,2023-09-01,,"Great taste, still using to see if it works. watch this space "
439,103615,2023-07-27,,These taste good and work fine but I wish the bottle had more I them and gummies didn't stick to each other
440,103615,2023-07-07,,"Easy way to increase my child's magnesium and L-theanine levels, since it tastes pleasant enough. "
441,103615,2023-06-22,"Nice flavour, subtle results",We've recently started taking these and are noticing subtle results in ability to concentrate and focus. We'll keep going! 
442,103615,2023-05-12,,My daughter loves the taste of these and they do help
443,103615,2023-05-04,,honestly not sure on effect. doesn't seem to really slow the kiddo down to calm before bed but likes the taste..
444,103615,2023-04-24,,not sure if its the supplement making my son calmer when he hv nervous breakdown 
445,103615,2023-03-25,,Children like the taste. could not see any effect on sleep paterns
446,103615,2023-03-06,,Too soon to say if they are working. Taste and smell of gummie is good. Only issue is they come stuck together.
447,103615,2023-02-26,,After long travelling or in case of over exiting it nice help for my toddler to calm down
448,103615,2022-12-07,,This help for my autism nephew . Great quality. Use after food.
449,103615,2022-08-13,,"Very well. Delivery prompt. The packaging is super, high quality, dense. I recommend."
450,103615,2022-05-11,Was sceptical but there's definitely good results,Despite our almost 8 yo ASD daughter changing her mind on whether she likes the taste or not we've definitely observed better behaviour after taking two of these.  It doesn't prevent the big meltdowns but she is much more relaxed about the world and her environment in general.  It does seem like we've avoided some meltdowns because she's taken these
451,103615,2024-05-11,Calm.,For a young person who struggling with social anxiety it's a game changer.It helped my daughter to maintain calm moody Recommended!!!!
452,103615,2022-08-24,,"The gummy tastes great. Tends to clump together. Even after finishing the whole bottle, I didn't notice any difference about its effect on my son (who has ADHD). He did like taking it though. He said it tastes just like regular gummy candies. "
453,103615,2022-02-12,the kids like the flavour,"I don't know if it works because of the active ingredients, or it's a placebo effect - but it does seem to help the kids regulate their big feelings.
They like the flavour and texture of the gummies."
454,103615,2022-05-29,,"Great value for money, tastes ok ,can be used daily without a worry"
455,103615,2023-08-21,Son couldn't swallow it because of the taste. :(,"As the title says, unfortunately my son couldn't even swallow it because of the taste & had to spit it out after starting to gag. Hopefully it works for others because the ingredients are great but we'll never know how well it would work for him!"
456,103615,2023-08-18,,I bought it thinking it would benefit my adhd toddler but it actually didn‚Äôt change her behavior and I don‚Äôt see her calmer or even see this so effective to be honest
457,103615,2023-08-01,Taste was too strong for us,I got this for my kids but none of us liked the taste. It was just too strong for us. We will finish the bottle but probably not buy again.
458,103615,2023-04-09,Not effective ,"These are not working for me son. It‚Äôs been two weeks. In fact he has had some of the worst breakdowns and tantrums while on them. It‚Äôs been about 12 days. 
Unless I need to give it more time!!! "
459,103615,2023-03-23,no effect,tried after many good reviews for calming hyperness and concentration but till now in our case no effect on my 8 year kid will use second bottle. parents can  do just try and hope
460,103615,2022-04-23,Not sure about these..,"Perhaps it's owing to a different feeling in my kids bodies or that it takes time for them to get used to, but I didn't notice any calmness. On the contrary, I observed the opposite. Will try again just to test the theory. "
461,103615,2023-09-03,,"Took a few days, have not seen any effect yet. Hopefully will be able to calm my son‚Äôs tics"
462,103615,2023-07-25,Don't see any effect,The flavor of these gummies is not the best. Too bad they don't have other flavors.
463,103615,2023-05-09,,"I didn't notice a big difference in my kid's mood, but he appeared calmer after the gummie."
464,103615,2023-04-12,,I didn't see much difference in my child. She really liked the taste though!
465,103615,2023-04-08,,I am not sure if this helps kids to be calm / collective but kids surely love the flavour! 
466,103615,2023-03-01,,My son didn‚Äôt like the taste and the gummy shape is not attractive to kids 
467,103615,2023-02-06,,Tastes good but the ingredients weren‚Äôt anything spectacular. My kids loved them though. 
468,103615,2021-10-01,it works!,i have a 9years old daughter and she's been experiencing mood swings due to cabin fever and these gummies helped her a lot. will 100d repurchase
469,103615,2021-05-04,,My kids don‚Äôt really like these sadly but I wish they did because they‚Äôre a great product. Maybe I‚Äôll take them. Everyone is happy when mom is calm! 
470,103615,2021-04-13,,"Really happy with these gummies, they seem to do the trick. They have a nice grape jelly flavour for kids so easy for them to have."

610,103615,2024-05-17,IMPORTANT RULES OF FAMILY LIFE,"In the developed world, family structure has changed radically. In families where both work and their elderly parents live separately, when you can buy semi-finished products or eat out, rituals, rules of conduct, expectations become different. These days, it is not tradition, but chance that decides who is responsible for what and what is required from whom. And many families live like in hell. What to do? Before getting married, lovers should sit down and, after cool-headed thinking, make a written agreement about everything. What values do they share and what assumptions cannot be broken? How many children do they want? Who will be the main breadwinner? Where will they live and what size house do they need? Who washes the dishes, and who manages the family budget? It is necessary to discuss everything openly, so that later no one complains that he is being forced to follow rules that he did not sign up for."

634,103615,2024-08-28,My update after buying two boxes ,"This is my last update on the product after months of use and trying to convince my son that it doesn't taste good for my child. He refused to take it even though it was a gift for him. I couldn't convince him, so I will stop buying it. I wanted it to be a gift for my son. I ordered it twice, and that's it. But for children with strong tastes like my son, I think it should be divided into small pieces so that the child can eat it without any problems. My son is autistic, he is 8 years old. I used this product with him and it was very useful, especially before bedtime, because it makes him sleep for long hours without interrupting his sleep and sometimes without sleeping pills. One pill a day is enough. I won't order it again unless they renew the flavors.

711,103615,2024-02-22,TIPS FOR A HEALTHY LIFE,"‚úîÔ∏è Do not drink alcohol. Like caffeine, alcohol is a diuretic. Not only that, it has been repeatedly proven that alcohol causes immeasurable harm to your body as a whole and to many organs separately. ‚úîÔ∏è Learn to cook your favorite dishes. When cooking meals yourself, you control what is added to them and how the food is processed. Also, the key point is that you see the quality of the products in the dish you have prepared. ‚úîÔ∏è Learn to say ""no"". If you do not feel like eating when you are offered, then know how to politely refuse. This is better than agreeing and then suffering from overeating. ‚úîÔ∏è Carry a small water container with you. In this way, you will always be able to replenish your water balance if necessary. It also saves you money and you don't have to buy water or sugary drinks at the nearest store. ‚úîÔ∏è Quit smoking. All people know about the harm of cigarettes, all that remains is to overcome this craving and get rid of the bad habit. ‚úîÔ∏è Avoid passive smoking. When you stand next to a person who smokes, you also get your share of harmful smoke. Try to avoid people who smoke. ‚úîÔ∏è Healthy snacks. If you get hungry while working, it's a good idea to have any fruit or nuts on hand to snack on. It will be a tasty, healthy and light snack. ‚úîÔ∏è Drink fruit and vegetable cocktails. These cocktails are a quick way to get vitamins and nutrients. Just throw your favorite fruit into the blender, wait 30 seconds, and you're done. ‚úîÔ∏è Be in the fresh air more often. If you are an office worker and sit in the office from morning to evening, try to go outside whenever possible to distract yourself from work, breathe fresh air, stretch your legs, rest your eyes and more. On weekends, you should also go for a walk alone or with friends if possible. ‚úîÔ∏èTransfer your immediate environment to proper nutrition. This will help you be less in a society where it is customary to consume harmful products and you will be less tempted to try them. And you will also make your friends and loved ones healthy."

1095,103615,2022-01-04,,"Why do children need magnesium? If in adult women an increased need for magnesium is formed primarily due to the needs of the reproductive system, then in children the main ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù of this element is the nervous system. Why do children need magnesium with B6? Childhood is considered a carefree time, but in reality it is filled with stressful situations. Adaptation to kindergarten, school, clubs, illness (and children get sick much more often than adults), study load, preparation for exams - all these are sources of stress. Therefore, magnesium is as necessary for children as it is for adults."

The effect appears by the end of the admission (approximately at the fourth week of admission): the children began to sleep more calmly (especially the younger one) - no throwing about the bed and nocturnal screams.

And it exceeded my expectations. We drank it for the first time in early spring, when the child was already tired of school, winter and became capricious, overexcited. After a week of reception, whims from scratch disappeared, sleep became better and homework stopped being a horror movie))) Now we always have them.

They improve absorption and enhance each other's action. There is no B6 overdose with these drugs.), L-theanine has a proven ability to improve learning, memory, and cognitive function, as well as enhance selective attention during mental tasks, in good dosage.

Gummies are very tasty, children can be given from the moment they are able to chew gummies. Up to 8 years old, 1 piece per day, from 8 years old, 2 pieces.

If the review was helpful, let me know)))"

The only problem with its presentation is that the lid system gets stuck to open, even following its instructions. Apart from that, a very good natural product to promote tranquility in children."
1505,103615,2021-08-11,,"Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: The role of this vitamin in supporting the nervous system cannot be overemphasized. Vit. B6 takes part in the production of blood cells and their coloring pigment - hemoglobin, and participates in the uniform supply of glucose to cells, as well as in maintaining the health of the nervous and immune systems. Like other B vitamins, it is a water-soluble vitamin, that is, it does not accumulate and is not stored in the body. Magnesium in citrate form is highly absorbable, which is why it is popular in supplements. Once in the digestive tract, the element easily enters the bloodstream through the walls of the stomach and is transported to deficient tissues. The action of magnesium citrate is reflected in many physiological processes. Since 99% of the substance is contained in bone, muscle and soft tissues, with a lack of it, malfunctions in the body are found. This is manifested in the disruption of the functioning of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, as well as in the development of other pathologies. Theanine is not synthesized in the human body and is not a substance necessary for its functioning. However, L-theanine affects the levels of certain chemical compounds in the central nervous system. These include serotonin and dopamine, which determine mood and sleep quality, and cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress. Herbal formulations are a good way to gradually and gently bring the internal emotional state back to normal, without exerting a gross effect on the psyche. The action does not become obvious immediately: it has a cumulative effect, and affects the body not directly, but indirectly, allowing you to activate internal reserves for self-healing. The benefits of lemon balm for the human body primarily lie in the fact that it is a powerful sedative. Passionflower is known as a sedative that is found in herbal sedatives. Its popularity is due to its delicate action, which does not cause drowsiness and side effects, but only relieves unpleasant symptoms: nervousness, insomnia, low mood."
