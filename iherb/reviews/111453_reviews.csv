30,111453,2022-09-06,Good help for sleep,"Melatonin Sambucus helps me fall asleep very well and also helps me fall asleep again if I should wake up. You have to be careful with the dosage: if I take more, the effect is even clearer, but I'm quite tired the next day. This is the case with many melatonin preparations and it is advisable to experiment with the dosage if necessary. As far as the taste is concerned, I can't say anything because I take the preparation via a stomach tube."
