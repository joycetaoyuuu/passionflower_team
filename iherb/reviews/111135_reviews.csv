0,111135,2024-05-21,Calmer Bedtime Routine,"We recently bought ChildLife Essentials Sleep Essential for our child. It's a melatonin-free, all-natural sleep aid that uses herbal ingredients to promote relaxation and calmness before bed. Our child likes the taste of the convenient liquid form, and it's easy to measure out the dosage. We've noticed a positive improvement in their bedtime routine, with them being calmer in the evenings and falling asleep easier. It's also nice to know the ingredients are all-natural and safe for children. Overall, we're happy with ChildLife Essentials Sleep Essential. It's a gentle and effective way to help our child get a better night's sleep. "
1,111135,2024-03-22,,Works well for getting my kids to calm down when they are too wild before bedtime. Will repurchase. Tastes a little strange and strong but it’s sweet and my kids like it. 
2,111135,2023-12-18,great stuff,I like this because there's no melatonin in it. Our 4 year old is full of energy and this helps her settle down when she needs it. And she says it's yummy.
3,111135,2023-11-10,"I'm not sure if it worked, pretty strong flavor","It has a strong flavor of herbs, but they cover it up pretty well. My kids were able to get it down, and they enjoyed the routine added to their bedtime routine, but I'm honestly not sure it helped much. Maybe for someone more sensitive and closer to sleep. "

6,111135,2023-11-13,Unsure and unusual taste,"Taste is not super sweet , but understandably has herby taste. Used a couple times so far and no bed wetting (which happened with melatonin cos child was in too deep a sleep). "

85,111135,2022-03-27,Satisfactorily,"I add a review after use: although it’s disgusting, the child drank the whole bottle, the drug works, I advise you to use it at the same time !!! The liquid is dark in color, the smell is present. The bottle is equipped with a pipette with dose marks. There is a rather strong aftertaste that repels the use of this drug ... the girl is 9 years old, gave her 1.5 ml, the child grimaced, fukal and washed down with water, falling asleep easily and quickly did not help at all, on the contrary, they suffered for 1.5 hours. Some write that it is a cumulative effect, but I definitely can’t give the child a nasty medicine to calm down when the child is psychologically tuned in already against the medicine. If the child agrees to drink, I will give a second chance. We drank Boiron before, there are 15 doses in a package, we drank 2 at a time, there is no taste, the child himself reminds me to drink, it works well, really calms. If the review was helpful please like it."
