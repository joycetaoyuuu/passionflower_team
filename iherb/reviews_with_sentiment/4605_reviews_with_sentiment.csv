4,4605,2008-05-21,I call this my CHILL PILL !,"At the beginning of menopause I was beginning to lose it.  I had such high anxiety, irritability, mood swings.  My doc put me on prosac which I hated.  I asked a health food store what I could do naturally and they recommended HTP-CALM.  I am now on the other side of menopause and 6 years later I am still taking it.  I've always been hyper with my mind racing a zillion miles an hour and with it I am more creative, focused and a happier human.  If I miss a dose I can tell right away because the anxiety returns.

5,4605,2008-02-18,nice without side effects,"I tend to suffer from moodiness associated with hormones, and living in dreary Vancouver where it rains over 300 days of the year really doesn't help with my outlook sometimes. 

I was taking St. John's Wort for a while, but after about 6 weeks, I only noticed some improvement, but no much during my ""hot"" days when I ovulate and several days priror to my period. 

I've been taking this for about 4 weeks now, and I had the mildest pms in recent memory. I was a tad irritable, but nothing like the godzilla I can turn into sometimes. 

I also sleep so much better while taking these, and it's nice to not be groggy or feel blunted if one is taking a sedative. It's also helped with anxiety associated with stress as well.

The bottle came with the inside seal open (most likely stuck on the lid and pulled off when I opened it). Iherb answered my email very promptly on a Sunday no less, and without hesitation sent out another bottle. I can't say enough about this site and the amazing products they carry.
