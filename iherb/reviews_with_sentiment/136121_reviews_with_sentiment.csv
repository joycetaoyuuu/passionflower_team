0,136121,2024-03-28,Highly recommend,"My yorkie puppy has bouts of being out-of-control crazy, especially when it comes to long car rides. These calming bites go a long way for taking the edge off and getting him to settle in. While he still doesn't enjoy long car rides, he is much more tolerant when dosed with these.","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.0168}",0.0168,neu
