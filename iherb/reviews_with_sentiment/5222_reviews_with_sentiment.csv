It helped me manage stress and maintain a more balanced state of mind.

Moreover, passionflower extract also acted as a natural sleep aid. By taking the supplement before bedtime, I experienced improved sleep quality and found it easier to fall asleep. The calming properties of passionflower helped quiet my mind and relax my body, allowing me to drift into a restful slumber. It was a welcome alternative to traditional sleep aids, as it felt gentler and more in harmony with my body's natural rhythms.

The passionflower supplement I used came in a convenient dropper form, which made it easy to measure and administer the desired dosage. The dropper allowed for precise control, ensuring I could adjust the amount according to my needs.

In case of cardiovascular diseases, the use of passionflower together with hawthorn is effective. At first impressions, everything is super. Tincture without alcohol in solid dark glass, with a convenient pipette dispenser. Feels like a pleasant liquid with the smell and taste of burnt caramel, the water colors in the color of black tea. I add 1-2 pipettes to a small amount of water half an hour to an hour before bed. If you have time and desire, you can brew a bag of chamomile, wait until the broth cools down and add passionflower. It turns out a delicious herbal tea (for chamomile lovers). The effect does not come instantly, you need to wait at least an hour. At the beginning of the course, the effect was very weak, there was a calming effect, but it did not affect sleep. The result became noticeable 2 weeks after application, already finishing the bottle. Apparently, there is a cumulative effect. Of the minuses, I note - uneconomical expense.

There is no depression or depression, I don‚Äôt wake up in the middle of the night (I sleep until the morning), that is, the main goal is to speed up the process of falling asleep. After seeing good reviews, I decided to try passionflower. I like Nature's Answer products because of their good natural composition, and the liquid form allows for better absorption. The only thing, as usual, I have a complaint about the pipette dispenser and recommendations: counting 70 drops is not very convenient every time, it‚Äôs easier to count the drops into pipettes. In addition, for some reason it is problematic to draw a full pipette at a time - only half is typed. In general, I stopped at a dosage of 2-3 ""half a pipette"". Initially, I diluted the solution in water, but the taste of passionflower is quite specific, so I switched to juice or fruit drink, which mask this taste. From one-time receptions, the effect was not noticed at all. When taken on an ongoing basis, there were slight improvements, as it seemed to me, but somehow unstable - you immediately fall asleep, then as usual. Given the cost of a jar and the manufacturer's recommendations, $ 10 for 2 weeks is somehow not very profitable.
