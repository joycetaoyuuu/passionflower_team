0,0,116775,2024-07-30,A Peaceful Companion,"My high-energy pup, Max, always had trouble settling down. He was anxious during thunderstorms, fireworks, and even car rides. I tried various calming aids, but nothing seemed to work until I found NaturVet Evolutions Advanced Calming Support.

I was impressed by the blend of Ashwagandha, chamomile, ginger, and other natural ingredients. After a few weeks of using the product, I noticed a significant difference in Max's behavior. He's calmer, more relaxed, and less reactive to loud noises.

The soft chews are easy to administer, and the fact that they're vet formulated and NASC certified gives me peace of mind. I'm so grateful for this product and would highly recommend it to any pet owner dealing with an anxious or stressed-out dog.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.308, 'compound': 0.9922}",0.9922,pos
1,1,116775,2024-08-22,Helps calm down,"I have been trying this supplement with my dogs recently since there have been loud thunders in my area and I think somehow it does help calm them down. Of course it doesn't work in an instant but I think it helps improve their mood and reaction to the loud thunder. The packaging is convenient since I don't always give it out to my dogs I can just leave it with the cap screwed on. The size of the chew is a little bit big for small dogs though, and I haven't tried giving it to my small dog since he's a picky eater but for the bigger dogs, it works great.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.8499}",0.8499,pos
