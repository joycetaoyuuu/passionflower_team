0,0,126042,2023-10-29,"Excellent product, pity about the natural flavors","I love that this drink makes me feel so relaxed and is full of health-promoting mushrooms and spices. However it's really too bad they use ""natural flavors"", a designation that can be used to hide any number of dangerous chemical additives. I think it's a very health-conscious companies and it's unlikely they are using bad ingredients, but it's totally unclear this way so use at your own risk.

7,7,126042,2023-11-20,A bit of a sleep aid,"The elderly at home brew this powder as gold milk and drink it at night before going to bed. The advantage is that it is added with monk fruit sugar instead of sucrose, and has coconut milk and vanilla flavors, which reduces the turmeric flavor and increases the sweetness. It seems to help the elderly at home relax and sleep better, but its price is a bit expensive, maybe because it contains ingredients like Ganoderma, which are more expensive.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.8625}",0.8625,pos
