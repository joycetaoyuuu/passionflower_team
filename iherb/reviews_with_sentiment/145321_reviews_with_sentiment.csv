ALA and Benfotiamine are a miracle combination for such condition, this supplement has enough dose for those benefits. In addition it has many other natural ingredients to help with neuropathic pain, numbness and help in mood. My old man loves it. Will order again.","{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': 0.836}",0.836,pos
