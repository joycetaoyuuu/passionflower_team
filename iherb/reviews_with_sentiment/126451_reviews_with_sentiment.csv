0,0,126451,2024-08-20,Very relaxing,"I take a couple of drops before going to bed if I feel stressy. It has an agreable taste and actually does make one kind of dossy before going to sleep.  I don't take it every night as it would be too much but in moments of pre sleep tension, it helps.  ","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.1154}",0.1154,pos

2,2,126451,2024-04-07,Very effective ,"Valerian of excellent quality. Since it is in a liquid, it works very quickly. I drip before going to bed as indicated on the bottle - I sleep like a child, although I have been living in Kyiv in constant stress and anxiety for 2 years. The only thing is that it is not clear why it says vanilla and lavender - it only smells like valerian and that's all. The taste is herbal. If the feedback was helpful, please click Yes.
