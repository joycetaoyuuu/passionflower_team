0,0,20582,2012-05-25,Excellent Product,"I've been taking MyoCalm PM for a few years now.  I started on the advice of my chiropractor.  This product is the best source of Valerian.  I take it with some Bluebonnet Nutrition, L-Tryptophan, 500 mg (also the best source for this product).  Herbalists & apothecaries throughout the millenia have used a combination of  Valerian & catnip as sleeping & relaxation aids.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.9153}",0.9153,pos
1,1,20582,2011-04-01,Great product!,This product works great for anyone who needs a little help relaxing to fall asleep due to minor muscle aches and pains.
