0,0,69695,2024-10-11,Perfect for Anxious Dogs,"These calming chews have been a lifesaver for my dog! She gets really anxious during thunderstorms and car rides, but after giving her these, she’s so much calmer. I like that it has melatonin for a natural calming effect without making her too sleepy. She also loves the taste, so no issue getting her to eat them. Highly recommend for any dog with anxiety!
