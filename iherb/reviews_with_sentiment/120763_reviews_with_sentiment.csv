0,120763,2024-08-25,Great help ,"Mommy’s Bliss Organic Baby Cough Syrup & Mucus  has been a great help when my little one is under the weather. The natural, organic high quality ingredients give me peace of mind, knowing that I'm not giving my baby anything harsh. The day formula helps soothe their cough and clears up mucus, making them more comfortable during the day, while the night formula has a calming effect that helps them sleep better despite the cough. The taste is mild and my baby doesn’t mind taking it, which is a big plus. I appreciate that it’s free from artificial flavors and preservatives. Overall, it’s a gentle yet effective remedy that I’m glad to have on hand during cold season.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.614, 'pos': 0.353, 'compound': 0.9927}",0.9927,pos

Use this useful household appliance to save your time, energy and the number of calories in your diet. Often we do not want to cook because we are very tired after work, so we order food home or go to a restaurant. Well, just learn how to cook fast food. Now there are many simple and tasty recipes in which you just need to mix all the ingredients and put them in a pan. 2. Apply sunscreen to your skin every day. So your skin will age much more slowly. 3. If you simply cannot do without fast food from time to time, order children's sets or small portions. So you will be full, and you will not feel guilty for the calories eaten. 4. Rule of two bites. If you want to eat something harmful, use the rule of two bites. Take a glass of cold water. Take a bite of your choice. Drink a glass of water. Wait 1-2 minutes and take a second bite. 5. If you are not sure that your diet is properly balanced, then a high-quality multivitamin complex is the cheapest way to insure your health. 6. Do 10 squats and 10 push-ups every morning. Later, you can increase the load and thus wake up much faster.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.8445}",0.8445,pos
