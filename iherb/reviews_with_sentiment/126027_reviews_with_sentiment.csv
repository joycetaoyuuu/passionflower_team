0,0,126027,2024-04-22,Nice!,"I bought this after seeing it in a youtube vlog about bath products with nice packaging, but I was surprised how much I liked the product itself! The scent is very subtle and soothing, at least in comparison to other bubble baths. I think it is perfect for kids or people that are sensitive to smells, as the smell isn't artificial. Would love to try the other options once they restock! :)","{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.702, 'pos': 0.245, 'compound': 0.9467}",0.9467,pos
1,1,126027,2023-10-02,Great scent but no bubbles,"I bought this because the package is so cute and the ingredients seem to be gentle ( not too chemical). 
And results were
-the scent was great!
-easy to measure without mess
-the bubble was .... I didn't see any bubbles!

If you are looking for something bubbly maybe this is not a choice. But for others, looking for something smells nice and  safe for kids, this is great!
Overall I like this Aromasaurus.

I added about 3 more cups from there, but there were almost no bubbles...Maybe it's not bad as a bath salt, but I bought it expecting a bubble bath, so this is it.
