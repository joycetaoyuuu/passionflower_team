I take them 30mins before going to bed, which enables me to fall asleep in minutes.  Other sleeping tablets left me feeling groggy in the mornings but this brand doesn't for me. It is expensive but hey getting a good 7 hr to 8 hours sleep out weighs the cost in my opinion. I like this brand because it has the best combination of natural ingredients  that will guarantee a good night sleep.  If I'm feeling anxious I take 2 tablets but if I'm feeling ok I find that one is enough. ","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.9826}",0.9826,pos
