0,121078,2024-08-22,,"My four-legged child tends to get anxious and pants non-stop after daily walks or zoomie sessions, especially when she knows she’s knocked something over that she shouldn’t have. She can pant for up to 45 minutes or even an hour, and sometimes at night, she’s too wound up from playtime to sleep, throwing little tantrums instead. Healthy Calm has been a lifesaver! Giving her just one chew, while staying by her side and petting her, calms her down, and she’ll eventually lay beside me and fall asleep, staying restful through the night. I only give it to her when really needed, but it’s incredibly effective when we’re out of ideas on how to soothe her. Highly recommend it for anyone dealing with a similarly anxious pup!","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9467}",0.9467,pos
