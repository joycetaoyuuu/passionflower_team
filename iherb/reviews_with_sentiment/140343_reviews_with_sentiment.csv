0,0,140343,2024-06-07,Was waiting for it to be avail! ,"I absolutely love oily mists for my morning care! I have dry skin and I only do face cleaning and the full skincare routine in the evening. In the morning I found the best method is to just rinse my face with water (do not wipe the water) let it dry, or semi dry and than spray a few times of this oil spray, afterwards apply moisturizer and/or spf. The spray in combo with spf makes my really well moisturized during the day. In the evening continue with your usual routine. The spray itself is not cheap and is similar to Huxley oil spray but I absolutely love the clean ingredients, and it lasts around 2,5-3 months if spraying everyday 3-4 times. Please like my review if it was helpful! ","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.9831}",0.9831,pos
