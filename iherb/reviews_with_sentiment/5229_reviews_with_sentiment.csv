My only concern is that one time it made my period to start one week early. I googled and yes, passion flower makes your uterus contract more, so no surprise it happened to me.

Helps when I start feeling my heart pounding or beating fast.  Because it is alcohol free I can put and keep a dropperful or two under my tongue (acts fastest this way) for several minutes.  I also use it at night, along with kava, to help me sleep - that's when my anxiety seems to come on the worst.  Does it taste pleasant?  No :-)  But, then no herbal things do.
