"Swanson Lemon Balm, Passion Flower, Skullcap Complex 180 Capsules",611375671,Jackie,,Decent product  just not strong enough for me,Good quality as usual for Swanson which is my brand of choice.  this would be great for someone with milder issues.  however as someone who has severe sleep issues like not sleeping for 3 or 4 days without RX meds and herbals combined this isn't strong enough.  my fault for not reading the label.,5/5,10/5/2023

Solaray Passion Flower Aerial Extract 60 Veg Caps,159552147,Jack Russell,,Honest ,"In my search I saw another Solary Passion Flower product at 350mg with a green cap/lid. It was more pills for less. At an earlier time I bought the 250mg extract with the red cap from a store (60 pills). I will continue to buy the red cap because it works - I don't know the green cap one so I will not buy it. Few of these natural type products work, but if I take two of PF before bed I go from getting 4 or 5 so-so hours of sleep to 7 or 8 sleeping-like-I-am-a-teenager-again hours of sleep. I went to WF's yesterday and bought some Passion Flower for about 3 times as much as here. I figured, hey it's WF's, it must be good; think again. The red cap Solaray 250mg extract actually works. - This is an honest  by a real consumer. Oh, and although I am lean and fit I suffer at times from sleep apnea. On some nights I will awake in the middle of the night with my heart pounding. It's my adrenaline that is jacked from a flight or fight reaction from having not breathed. When this happens I cannot get back to sleep for an hour or 2, if at all. So I wear an SPO2 monitor that goes on the wrist with a sensor that covers the end of a finger. If my O2 drops below 88% an alarm sounds waking me. It can be a real pain but it intervenes before the fight or flight kicks in. This is a big help. The apnea can be real bad if I have had a few drinks. I suspect that I whacked my head a few times over the years and probably did some minor brain damage to my sleep centers. This causes the apnea",5/5,12/20/2023
Solaray Passion Flower Aerial Extract 60 Veg Caps,159552147,Craig B.,,"It works for me,  calming my mind.","I have been using this on and off---it really seems to help calm me,  especially if I throw low dose lithium (10mg) and some other herbs like lemon balm and/or l-theanine with it.   I think the passion flower is the most potent of any of the others I use or have tried---all by itself.   I have tried Swanson brand---but the Solar Ray extract really seems to be the best by far.",5/5,12/21/2023

"Nature's Truth Calm Caps™ Plus Passion Flower & Chamomile, 90 Quick Release Capsules",644868914,iHerb Customer,,"A Blessing for Calmness, Without Side Effects!"," I am absolutely thrilled with Nature's Truth's Calm Caps. This product has made a significant impact on my life, helping me feel calmer and more serene, without any feeling of drowsiness.
Its effectiveness is truly impressive. After starting to take them, I noticed a tangible change in my level of calmness. Not only do I feel more relaxed, but I also manage to maintain my clarity and focus throughout the day.
Another aspect that I greatly appreciate about these capsules is their natural composition. As a vegan and nature lover, I find it very important that the products I use are as natural and environmentally friendly as possible. Nature's Truth's Calm Caps perfectly reflect this philosophy of mine.
Moreover, the value for money is excellent. Not only does the product work great, but the price is also very reasonable, considering the number of capsules you receive per package.
Finally, I have not experienced any unwanted side effects. This is a great advantage, as many similar products can cause drowsiness or other unwanted effects. With Calm Caps, on the other hand, I simply feel calmer and more relaxed, while maintaining my normal energy and attention.

I always make a pitcher at night (6 minutes on high in microwave) and refrigerate it, then sip it as an iced tea throughout the day when plain water loses its appeal.  I mix one bag of the passion tea and 1 bag of the Tazo wild orange tea flavors together.   I start drinking plain water in the morning and as the day goes on I top off my water bottle with this tea combo..... it's so refreshing especially when the temperatures hit the triple digits in Phoenix for 4 months, although I love it year round.",5/5,11/18/2024

yet it didn't do anything for me personally. and it was not very flavorful to in my opinion. certainly wouldn't be purchased as a beverage of choice by me. 

okay for a holistic approach to medications if you go that route. wouldn't suggest someone not get it, but for me the return on investment isn't worth it. 

tea 3 times a day say 20 minutes or a pill once or twice in 20 seconds and cost for a month being 3 times more than a prescription co-pay combined is a loss of both time and money.

again, for a holistic approach it's not an overly expensive option to try. but whether or not it would do this, that or any other thing for YOU I can't say. you'd have to try it.

"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,Lauderbabe,,Calming Tea,"A tea with not much flavor but that's because I put lemon and sugar in mine and don't drink many teas ""straight"". It does have a slight calming effect as it states; I drink a cup every night 1-2 hours before bed. I , as many, have to be careful of many herbal tea ingredients, so be sure to read ingredients carefully so you do not consume something you may be allergic to.",5/3,4/27/2025
"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,Jen,,Great tasting tea!!,"I did enjoy this tea, the color was light greenish yellow and still flavorful. I enjoyed this with a little and also without sugar but it's so good either way. I have had it daily after lunch or dinner it's really good. In the photo it shows more of the color.",5/5,4/28/2025
"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,LondonGal,,Not bad but too bland for me,"I was interested in trying this tea since I've never had any with passionflower before. The light, clear color of the tea after steeping for about 5 minutes looked appealing to me. Some teas that I drink are dark and not as clear after brewing so the ""clear and clean"" look of this tea impressed me. However, the taste of the tea was disappointing. I like teas that are fragrant and have at least a hint of taste. This didn't have either for me. So for those that enjoy more subtle flavored teas, this one's for you. In addition, teas are known to be diuretics and this definitely had that effect.",5/3,4/29/2025
"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,Katie100,,Mild tea,"I enjoy trying different coffees and teas. I had never heard of passionflower tea and thought I would give it a try. I expected a floral aroma but it's very unusual, sort of musty. However, once you steep a cup and add a bit of honey it is a nice, mild, relaxing cup of non- caffeinated tea. The box is well packaged and the tea bags are individually wrapped to keep them fresh.
Give it a try!",5/3,4/30/2025
"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,Tahitianflower,,Pleasant and Relaxing,"The tea has a very light, pleasant, earthy and flowery taste. It's soothing and calming as I believe is its purpose. Personally I prefer a stronger tasting tea and I'm not sure if it's distinguishable from similar teas which is why I gave it four stars. The tea is worth trying and probably just perfect for others tastes.",5/4,5/1/2025
"Santo Remedio Caffeine-Free Passionflower Herbal Tea Bag, 24 Count, 0.85 oz., Blue Box",354780174,KDubb,,Helpful tea with an earthy taste,"You can tell that this tea is made with quality ingredients. The aroma of the dry tea is very strong, and when brewed the taste is very earthy, reminiscent of pure maté. 

I drank this tea as I was winding down and felt it helped put me in a better mindset for sleep.",5/4,5/2/2025
